# HAVEN — Voice-First Elder Care Companion

**Your parent's guardian. Your peace of mind.**

HAVEN is a privacy-first, voice-first elder-care platform for older adults in the Netherlands and the families and care professionals who support them. It combines fraud protection, medication support, family connection, cognitive/orientation safety, a warm voice companion and professional care workflows into one coherent product suite.

This repository is an end-to-end production-shaped HAVEN build. It contains the Expo elder, carer, and grandchild apps; the Next.js family dashboard; Supabase schema, storage policies, and Edge Functions; shared packages; ML safety assets; tests; release documentation; deployment scripts; and compliance-support records.

---

## Current build status

The repository is the **HAVEN vNext build plus the June 20, 2026 end-to-end runtime/configuration fixes** layered on top of the original v1.2.1 SSOT. It implements the design-document feature surface plus vNext extensions (fall detection, daily check-ins, daily family status, trust signal, scam coaching, Familiar Voice, live video calling, carer handover notes, storage signed URLs, hosted smoke scripts, and local Supabase verification) behind feature flags and environment gates.

Validation currently reports:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "app": "apps/iphone-suite/index.html",
  "edgeFunctions": 81,
  "schemaBytes": 158544
}
```

### Build layers

| Layer | Source | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Original SSOT** | `designdoc.md` v1.2.1 | ~6,939 | Built |
| **P0 security hardening closure** | 12 migrations + 55 Edge Functions | ~2,900 SQL / ~5,500 TS | Built (June 2026) |
| **vNext Well-Rounded Patch** | `docs/implementation/VNEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` | 13 migrations + 72 Edge Functions at the time of that report | Built (June 2026) |
| **End-to-end runtime/config pass** | Supabase grants/lint fixes, Expo/EAS/env wiring, hosted smoke script, demo-data removal, token encryption/config gates | 81 Edge Functions + current migrations | Built (June 20, 2026) |
| **Test pyramid** | `tests/edge/*.test.mjs` + `tests/rls/*.audit.mjs` + `tests/integration/live-rls.test.mjs` + static smoke tests | full local suite | Green locally |

### vNext patch at a glance

The vNext directive summarised in `docs/implementation/VNEXT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` was applied in-place. It added:

- **1 schema migration** (`20260614000000_vnext_wellrounded_patch.sql`) with **14 new tables** + 11 telemetry columns on `device_sessions` + 6 seeded consent packs + 10 new feature flags + forced RLS on every new user-data table.
- **16 new Edge Functions** + **4 patches** to existing ones.
- **Elder app**: check-in card, Are-you-OK fall modal, medication confirmation card, scam-coaching button, Familiar Voice toggle.
- **Family app**: Daily status pill, Trust signal panel, two-way action buttons, Familiar Voice recording page.
- **Carer portal**: handover-notes form + offline-first queue + MAR-light entry.
- **Behavioural + RLS test coverage** grew to ~50+ assertions, all green.

Current local verification status:

- `corepack pnpm run typecheck` passes.
- `corepack pnpm run lint` passes.
- `corepack pnpm test` passes.
- `corepack pnpm run quality:check` passes, including the Next.js family production build.
- `./scripts/ci/verify-local-supabase.sh` has passed in this working tree after clearing poisoned Supabase temp cache, applying migrations, parsing DB lint output, and running live local RLS checks.

Current remaining boundary:

- Real production/staging secret values still need to be filled for EAS, Supabase, and vendors.
- `corepack pnpm run smoke:hosted` still needs hosted Supabase URL/JWT/internal key values before it can prove hosted Edge Functions and Storage.
- Physical iOS/Android runtime behavior still needs device validation for camera, mic/TTS, push notifications, offline queues, and background/foreground behavior.
- DPO/DPIA, vendor DPAs/SCCs, external pentest, usability sessions, and app-store approval remain human/commercial gates.

### Security Boundary Hardening (P0 Audit Complete)

In a rigorous senior security audit, multiple P0 and P1 security trust boundaries were identified and immediately hardened across the codebase:

1. **`fn-voice-pipeline` (FIX 1 & 20):** Eliminated high-privilege `admin()` database clients for elder-scoped actions. Extracted real user JWT tokens, bound caller identity, and added dynamic delegate checks allowing only authorized family members and carers. Enforced active `withIdempotency` wrapping to prevent patient-safety risks (such as medication double-confirmation events).
2. **`fn-storage-signed-url` (FIX 2):** Bounded folder-level storage paths to strict elder UUID matching. Enforced cryptographic format checks on directory owner segments (`ownerId`) and added directory-traversal protection (`..` and `\`). Banned family delegate access to the privacy-sensitive `document-vault` and `ocr-inbox` buckets.
3. **`fn-transaction-intercept` (FIX 3):** Fully fail-closed transaction webhooks. The receiver enforces signature checking in all cloud environments, halting execution and returning a `500 Server Misconfiguration` block if missing or misconfigured, while maintaining local-development convenience.
4. **GDPR Export Completeness & Compliance (FIX 11 & 12):** Aligned `public.export_elder_data` with GDPR Articles 15 & 20. Swapped the function to `security definer` to safely bypass column-level coordinate blocks for the elder themselves, enabling the export of `location_precise` in a highly secure, restricted JSON payload.
5. **`verify_jwt` Alignment (FIX 4):** Explicitly declared compensating controls inside `supabase/config.toml` for functions running with `verify_jwt = false` and enforced standard gateway JWT validations for all user-facing endpoints.

Full test command:

```bash
corepack pnpm test
```

Current test coverage includes:

- **suite structure validation** (`validate:suite` — 71 functions + 158 KB schema + every required file present)
- **scam-engine tests** (5 NL rule patterns + scoring)
- **screen-schema constitution tests** (UX enforcement: ≤2 nav depth, ≤4 items, emergency button, banned AI copy)
- **Edge Function hardening checks** (markers: every protected function references the right authz helpers)
- **authz behavioural tests** (27 assertions exercising real `_shared/authz.ts` against a mock Supabase client)
- **RLS policy static audit** (15 critical tables with forced RLS, all expected policies)
- **Storage policy static audit** (7 buckets + 4 critical policies)
- **data-lifecycle diff audit** (export + erasure coverage of every GDPR-relevant table)
- **vNext RLS audit** (17 assertions covering all 14 new tables, family/carer/permission gating, every new feature flag)
- **iPhone-suite smoke test** (render + accessibility + screen constitution)

### Production-launch note

This repository is production-shaped and locally green, but it is not truthfully production-launched. A real production launch still requires external operational gates:

1. Hosted Supabase staging/production project with migrations, secrets, storage buckets, and Edge Functions deployed.
2. `smoke:hosted` and live RLS/API checks run against hosted Supabase with real test JWTs.
3. Physical iPhone and Android validation.
4. Vendor sandbox and production credentials.
5. DPO-signed DPIA.
6. Vendor DPAs/SCCs.
7. External penetration test.
8. Older-adult usability sessions.
9. App Store / Play Store submissions and approvals.

These are tracked in the release and compliance documentation.

## Haven-build-ui: Vision UI Implementation

This repository (`Haven-build-ui`) extends the original Haven-build codebase with a complete **havenUIvision** design implementation, targeting **Android APK builds** with bilingual **EN/NL** support across all three mobile apps.

### Vision UI screens

| App | Screens | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Elder** (11 screens) | Home, Pills, Shield, Family, Stem, Today, Buurt, Kompas, Wacht, Settings, More | Personalized greeting, medication cards with OCR, scam protection with risk levels, voice companion with recording, daily check-in, neighbourhood connector, safe zones, care status |
| **Carer** (5 tabs) | Vandaag, Handover, MAR-light, Veiligheid, Bezoeken | Daily checklist, handover notes with BSN guard, medication administration, meldcode 5-step safeguarding, visit history |
| **Family Dashboard** (6 tabs) | Overview, Medications, Alerts, Care, Voice, Privacy | Daily status pill, medication adherence %, trust signal panel, care timeline, VAPI voice (deferred), consent toggles |

### Supabase Edge Function wiring

All five "Must Be Real" features are wired to real Supabase Edge Functions with graceful fallback:

| Feature | UI Screen | Edge Function | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medication confirm | Elder PillsScreen | `fn-voice-pipeline` + REST query | Mock data if unauthenticated |
| Voice pipeline | Elder StemScreen | `fn-voice-pipeline` (audio + text) | Alert if no session |
| Carer handover | Carer HandoverTab | `fn-carer-handover-note` | Offline IndexedDB queue |
| Family hello | Family OverviewTab | `fn-grandchild-message-send` | Silent skip if no token |
| Push notifications | All 3 apps | `fn-push-token-register` | Graceful skip if denied |

### Shared component library

Located in `packages/ui/src/`:

- `visionComponents.tsx` — GradientCard, StatusBadge, ProgressBar, MoodPicker, ConsentToggle, TimeSlotPill, StockIndicator
- `visionColors.ts` — Pillar gradient definitions
- `mockData.ts` — 482-line offline mock data layer
- `tokens.ts` — Design tokens (colors, spacing)

### Android APK builds

All 3 apps build as **release APKs** (not debug) for Android:

```bash
# From each app's android/ directory after expo prebuild:
cd apps/elder/android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
cd apps/carer/android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
cd apps/grandchild/android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Key build fixes applied:**
- `expo-linear-gradient` upgraded from `14.1.5` to `56.0.4` (fixed `LazyKType` crash)
- `unimodules-app-loader` forced to `56.0.1` via pnpm overrides
- All apps unified on Expo SDK 56 / React Native 0.85.3 / React 19.2.3

### Bilingual EN/NL

Every screen, button, label, alert, and placeholder supports both English and Dutch via a `locale` parameter (defaulting to `nl-NL`). The locale propagates through `ScreenContext` (elder), props (carer/family), and `I18nProvider`.

### Edge Functions

There are currently **81 Edge Functions** in `supabase/functions`. They are classified into explicit trust zones per `docs/implementation/EDGE_FUNCTION_TRUST_BOUNDARY_MATRIX.md`:

- user-scoped functions (`verify_jwt = true`) use the caller's JWT and relationship/permission checks
- admin/service functions use explicit admin bearer or service execution paths
- vendor-facing functions use HMAC/shared-secret validation
- internal scheduled/background functions require `HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY`

A complete catalog is available here:

```text
docs/api/EDGE_FUNCTION_CATALOG.md
```

OpenAPI surface:

```text
docs/api/openapi.yaml
```

Major function groups:

- Voice and companion memory
- Scam/browser/call reputation
- Medication OCR/reminders/refills
- Document analysis
- Location/safe zone/wandering/driving
- BUURT discovery/matching/events
- Family/grandchild messages
- Care plans/visit logs/incidents
- Consent/preferences/erasure/export
- Compliance/release/breach/vendor registry
- Observability/SLO/log drains
- External integrations: PSD2, MedMij/FHIR, care systems

## Security and privacy model

HAVEN follows a privacy-first model from the design document:

- Row-Level Security enabled and forced on user-data tables.
- Elder owns their data.
- Family access requires consent and per-feature permissions.
- Carer access requires active relationship and elder consent.
- Companion memory is elder-private.
- Document vault is elder-only.
- BUURT never exposes third-party elder identity before double opt-in.
- Precise location is only stored for active safe-zone events and is nulled after 24 hours.
- Family location view is fuzzed only.
- BSN is not stored, processed or transmitted.
- DigiD is deferred and not implemented as auth.
- Audit logs track sensitive changes.
- Right to erasure and data export are implemented.

Detailed docs:

```text
docs/release/PRIVACY_POLICY_EN.md
docs/release/PRIVACY_POLICY_NL.md
docs/release/PENTEST_SCOPE.md
docs/release/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md
```

playwright.config.ts
```

---

## Local development

Install runtime dependencies from the monorepo root:

```bash
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run validation:

```bash
corepack pnpm run validate:suite
```

Run lint coverage:

```bash
corepack pnpm run lint
```

Run typecheck coverage:

```bash
corepack pnpm run typecheck
```

This currently checks:
- shared packages
- Expo elder app
- Expo grandchild app

The Next.js family app gets its TypeScript validation through the production build step:

```bash
corepack pnpm run build:family
```

Preview the static app surfaces:

```bash
corepack pnpm run preview:iphone
corepack pnpm run preview:family
```

Build the Next.js family dashboard:

```bash
corepack pnpm run build:family
```

Run the combined quality gate locally:

```bash
corepack pnpm run quality:check
```

Run the root engineering orchestration locally:

```bash
corepack pnpm run verify:core
```

Optional browser E2E coverage:

```bash
corepack pnpm exec playwright install chromium
corepack pnpm run verify:browser
```

Optional local Supabase orchestration:

```bash
corepack pnpm run verify:supabase:local
```

Hosted Supabase smoke test, after staging/production secrets and test JWTs are available:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=... \
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... \
HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY=... \
HAVEN_TEST_ELDER_ID=... \
HAVEN_TEST_ELDER_JWT=... \
corepack pnpm run smoke:hosted
```

Run all tests:

```bash
corepack pnpm test
```

### Supabase local reset

A real local reset requires Supabase CLI and Docker.

Run:

```bash
./scripts/check-local-supabase.sh
```

That script executes:

```bash
supabase start
supabase db reset
supabase db lint --level warning
```

## Engineering rating

After the v1.2.1 hardening pass, the vNext Well-Rounded Patch, and the June 20, 2026 runtime/configuration pass, this repository is best described as:

> A substantially hardened, locally green, production-shaped engineering package for HAVEN. Schema, Edge Functions, app surfaces, Supabase local verification, and test coverage are in place behind feature flags and configuration gates. The live app paths no longer rely on hidden demo IDs or demo fixtures, and production-risk integration paths now fail fast when required secrets/config are absent.

Current engineering readiness rating: **9.3/10 for local/pre-production code readiness**.

The remaining gap requires:
1. Hosted Supabase staging/production smoke and live RLS/API verification
2. Real devices (physical iPhone / Android) + vendor sandbox credentials
3. DPO-signed DPIA + vendor DPAs/SCCs
4. External penetration test + older-adult usability sessions
5. App Store / Play Store submissions

These are documented as external gates in `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`, `PRODUCTION_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_HUMAN_GATES.md`, and `docs/implementation/RESIDUAL_HARDENING_REPORT.md`.
