# 🔴 HAVEN-build — Senior Security Red Team Audit

**Auditor:** Senior Security Engineer / Open-Source Maintainer  
**Date:** 2026-06-14  
**Target:** `knarayanareddy/Haven-build` @ commit `847a103` (vNext Well-Rounded Patch)  
**Current addendum:** 2026-06-20 runtime/configuration pass removed the live demo elder UUID path, added hosted smoke scripts, encrypted Tink refresh-token storage, and made internal/regulatory fallback URLs fail-fast/configurable.
**Severity Scale:** P0 (Critical/Immediate) → P1 (High/This Sprint) → P2 (Medium/Backlog)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

HAVEN-build has impressive security architecture on paper (forced RLS, JWT, idempotency, BSN-free), but the **implementation contains 25 security findings**, including **6 Critical (P0)** vulnerabilities. Several are trivial to exploit and would result in full data compromise.

---

## 🔴 P0 — 6 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### P0-1: CORS Wildcard `*` on All Edge Functions
**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/core.ts`  
**Risk:** Any malicious website can make authenticated cross-origin requests using victim's JWT. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header allows any origin to call authenticated endpoints with credentials.

**Fix:** `core.ts` now exports `corsHeaders(req)` that validates the `Origin` header against `HAVEN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (default `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:4173,exp://*,haven://*`). Every function response uses this dynamic CORS.

---

### P0-2: Internal Access Key Falls Back to SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/internal.ts`  
**Risk:** `readInternalKey()` fell back to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if `HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY` was unset. The service role key has unlimited DB access. 15+ functions using `requireInternalAccess` effectively exposed full DB admin via a single header match.

**Fix:** `readInternalKey()` now returns `null` if `HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY` is not explicitly set or is < 32 characters. `requireInternalAccess()` fails closed with `'HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY is not configured'`. Additionally, comparison uses `timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing attacks on the internal key.

---

### P0-3: Error Messages Leak Internal Details
**File:** Every Edge Function audited at the time
**Risk:** Raw catch blocks returned Supabase DB errors, file paths, env variable names, SQL constraint names, internal function names directly to callers.

**Fix:** New `safeErrorMessage(e)` function in `core.ts` classifies errors and returns sanitised messages:
- Known app-level messages pass through
- JWT/token errors → `"Authentication failed"`
- DB constraint errors → `"Resource already exists"`
- RLS/policy errors → `"Access denied"`
- Network/timeout errors → `"Service temporarily unavailable"`
- Parse errors → `"Invalid request format"`
- Everything else → `"An unexpected error occurred"`

---

### P0-4: No Rate Limiting on Any Endpoint
**Risk:** All functions audited at the time had zero rate limiting. Attackers can brute-force JWT tokens, flood `fn-onboarding` to create fake users, exhaust function memory, enumerate elder UUIDs.

**Fix:** New `ratelimit.ts` module implements in-memory sliding-window rate limiting (30 req/min/caller, identified by JWT suffix or IP). Applied to all sensitive endpoints: `fn-right-to-erasure`, `fn-onboarding`, `fn-scam-coaching`, `fn-emergency-profile`, and available via `havenHandler()` wrapper for all functions.

---

### P0-5: `fn-transaction-intercept` HMAC Bypass via Internal Header
**File:** `supabase/functions/fn-transaction-intercept/index.ts`  
**Risk:** The function had two auth paths — if `x-haven-internal-key` was present, HMAC verification was **entirely skipped**. Combined with P0-2, the service role key could inject fake financial transactions with no PSD2 signature verification.

**Fix:** Internal calls now **still log a webhook receipt** with `signature_valid = null` and `event_type = 'transaction_internal'`. HMAC verification is mandatory for all non-internal paths. The internal path requires explicit `HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY` (no service role fallback). Transactions are tagged `is_internal: true`.

---

### P0-6: `fn-right-to-erasure` Missing All vNext Tables
**File:** `supabase/functions/fn-right-to-erasure/index.ts`  
**Risk:** GDPR Art. 17 requires COMPLETE erasure. The hardcoded table list was missing **at least 14 vNext tables**: `fall_events`, `device_health_events`, `scam_coaching_sessions`, `elder_baselines`, `daily_checkin_schedule`, `medication_ocr_reviews`, `medication_interaction_alerts`, `voice_profiles`, `elder_voice_preferences`, `video_call_sessions`, `app_events`, `pending_confirmations`, `consent_pack_status`, `carer_handover_notes`, `carer_handover_recipients`. This is a regulatory compliance failure.

**Fix:** Complete table inventory now covers all 49+ tables. Clear three-phase approach: (1) soft-delete tables with `elder_id` column (including all vNext tables), (2) voice interaction nullification, (3) direct deletes including `profile_id` variants. `carer_handover_recipients` deleted via join with `carer_handover_notes`. `voice_profiles` cleaned up via `elder_id` column.

---

## 🟠 P1 — 8 HIGH FINDINGS

### P1-1: Timing Attack on HMAC Verification
**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/webhook.ts`  
**Fix:** `verifyHmacSha256()` now uses constant-time comparison. The new `timingSafeEqual()` function in `internal.ts` compares byte-by-byte without short-circuit.

### P1-2: `fn-onboarding` Has `verify_jwt = false` + User Creation Power
**Fix:** `fn-onboarding` now uses the hardened `requireInternalAccess()` (no service role fallback). Rate limiting added. User creation is gated behind independently-configured `HAVEN_INTERNAL_KEY`.

### P1-3: No Request Body Size Limits
**Fix:** `readRequestBody()` in `core.ts` enforces `HAVEN_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (default 1MB). `readJsonBody()` validates JSON parse. `validation.ts` adds `assertMaxLength()` + `MAX_STRING_FIELD` (10KB) and `MAX_AUDIO_BASE64` (10MB) constants.

### P1-4: `dispatchNotification` Missing Expo Push Auth Token
**Fix:** Now reads `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var and sends `Authorization: Bearer` header to Expo push API. Falls back gracefully if not configured.

### P1-5: `sentry.ts` Allows Arbitrary DSN — Data Exfiltration Vector
**Fix:** `captureException()` now validates DSN against `SENTRY_DSN_REGEX` (`https://<key>@<host>.ingest.(us|de).sentry.io/<project>`). Invalid DSNs are logged and ignored. Scrub function expanded to redact `secret`, `key`, `password`, `pin`, `bsn` fields.

### P1-6: No Content-Type Validation
**Fix:** `readRequestBody()` validates `Content-Type` is `application/json`, `text/plain`, or `multipart/form-data` before processing.

### P1-7: `fn-emergency-profile` Public Endpoint — Account Enumeration
**Fix:** Rate limiting added to both token creation and public lookup paths. Separate rate limit keys (`fn-emergency-profile-create`, `fn-emergency-profile-lookup`) prevent cross-contamination.

### P1-8: SQL Template Injection in `fn-right-to-erasure`
**Fix:** While the UUID comes from validated JWT (low risk), the `.or()` call is now preceded by additional UUID format validation, and the `carer_handover_recipients` cleanup uses a safe join-based approach instead of raw SQL.

## 🟡 P2 — 9 MEDIUM FINDINGS

| # | Finding | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| P2-1 | Missing security headers | `securityHeaders` const in `core.ts` adds `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `HSTS`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` to all responses |
| P2-2 | No CORS preflight caching | `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` added to all preflight responses |
| P2-3 | `fn-device-health-monitor` no deduplication | (Documented — needs idempotency wrapping in follow-up PR) |
| P2-4 | Hardcoded demo elder UUID | Fixed — live elder actions derive the profile ID from the authenticated Supabase session token |
| P2-5 | Browser Shield sends full page content | (Documented — consider content filtering before sending) |
| P2-6 | Voice intent classifier uses brittle regex | (Documented — upgrade to proper NL NLP model recommended) |
| P2-7 | Storage signed URL TTL max 900s | (Documented — consider longer TTL for voice playback use cases) |
| P2-8 | UUID-in-OR anti-pattern | Fixed in `fn-right-to-erasure`; `dispatchNotification` uses parameterised queries |
| P2-9 | No DB connection pooling | (Documented — Supabase client library handles this; consider connection reuse) |
