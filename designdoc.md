HAVEN — Engineering Design Document Suite
Version: 1.2.1 Status: Approved — Single Source of Truth Locale: Netherlands (nl-NL) | Jurisdiction: EU / Dutch Law Last Updated: 2026-06-10 Replaces: README.md, HAVEN_BLUEPRINT.md, UIUXRENDER

Document 01 — Product Specification
1. Mission
HAVEN is a voice-first elder-care companion platform built for older adults living in the Netherlands. It exists to protect dignity, reduce isolation, prevent fraud, and support daily independence — without surveillance, without panic, and without complexity.

HAVEN is not a tracking app. It is not a panic button. It is not a replacement for human care. It is a calm, trusted presence in an elder's daily life — and a reassuring, transparent window for the family members and professionals who care for them.

2. The Problem
Dutch older adults — particularly those aged 70 and above — face four compounding challenges:

Challenge	Dutch Context
Financial fraud & scams	In 2024, the Fraudehelpdesk registered **63,469 fraud reports** (meldingen) via callcenter and web form — a **10% increase** versus 2023 — with reported financial damage rising **20% to nearly €53 million**. Notably, **telephone fraud doubled** in 2024 compared to the year before. The majority of cases involved **helpdeskfraude** — fraudsters posing as helpdesk staff — including **bankhelpdeskfraude**, one of the most damaging forms, accounting for 6,057 reports alone. In 2025, this trend accelerated sharply: total meldingen reached **101,734** (a 60% rise over 2024), financial damage climbed to **€68.5 million** (+30%), and the number of financially harmed victims rose **65%** — while reported false emails numbered **522,103**. Elders are the primary target of "bankhelpdeskfraude", phishing, and "vriend-in-nood" (friend-in-need) scams.

> ⚠️ **DATA NOTE:** Fraudehelpdesk publishes two separate figures:
> (1) "Meldingen" — formal fraud reports via callcenter/webformulier
> (2) "Valse e-mails" — suspicious emails submitted to the valse-e-mailcheck
> These must never be combined into a single "reports" headline figure.
> Source: Fraudehelpdesk Jaarverslag 2024 (Feb 2025) + Terugblik 2025 (Feb 2026)
Loneliness & isolation	According to CBS (2024), **approximately 10% of Dutch people aged 15 and older** experience strong loneliness (*sterk eenzaam*); a further **30% report feeling somewhat lonely**, and 61% do not feel lonely. Among people **aged 65 and older specifically**, RIVM monitoring (CBS Sociale Samenhang en Welzijn data) shows the share reporting strong loneliness ranged between **7.5% (2024) and 8.7% (2023)**. Using the broader Gezondheidsmonitor Volwassenen en Ouderen 2024 (GGD/CBS/RIVM), **46% of Dutch adults (18+) report some form of loneliness**, of whom **33% are moderately lonely** and **13% strongly lonely**. The groups most at risk of strong loneliness are **people living alone (14%)** and single parents (18%). Loneliness is most prevalent among **young people and the very oldest**.

HAVEN's KRING pillar addresses a structural and growing loneliness challenge in the Netherlands. While the majority of older adults are not severely lonely in any given year, the cumulative risk rises sharply with age, isolation, bereavement, and reduced mobility — precisely the cohort HAVEN serves. Even moderate loneliness in this group is associated with significantly worse health outcomes and quality of life (CBS/RIVM, 2024).

> ⚠️ **DATA NOTE:** Two different surveys measure loneliness in NL with different methodology and age cut-offs, producing different headline percentages:
> (1) CBS Sociale Samenhang en Welzijn: 15+ population, ~10% sterk eenzaam (2024)
> (2) GGD/CBS/RIVM Gezondheidsmonitor Volwassenen en Ouderen: 18+, ~13% sterk eenzaam (2024)
> Both are valid; cite the source explicitly when using either figure.
> The "1 in 3 severe loneliness 75+" figure is NOT supported by either source and must not be used.
> Sources: CBS cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2025/39 | vzinfo.nl/eenzaamheid | rivm.nl/mentale-gezondheid
Medication non-adherence	Medication non-adherence is a structural challenge in the Netherlands. RIVM and IGJ monitoring consistently highlight **polypharmacy** — the use of five or more medications simultaneously — as a major risk factor among Dutch older adults.

WHO (2003, "Adherence to Long-Term Therapies") estimated ~50% adherence for chronic therapies in developed countries as a general benchmark. HAVEN does not claim a specific Dutch statistic here; the product justification is grounded in the **cognitive and logistical complexity of multi-drug regimens for older adults** as documented in Dutch pharmacovigilance and primary care literature.

**Source:** WHO "Adherence to Long-Term Therapies" (2003) for the 50% benchmark; RIVM polypharmacy monitoring (rivm.nl/geneesmiddelen) for the Dutch context.
Cognitive safety	Over 290,000 people in the Netherlands live with dementia (Alzheimer Nederland, 2025). Safe navigation and orientation support is an unmet gap in consumer tech.
3. Target Users
3.1 Primary User — The Elder
Age: 68–90
Lives independently or in a lightly assisted setting (thuiszorg)
Dutch mother tongue (nl-NL)
Low to medium digital literacy
May have reduced hearing, vision, or motor dexterity
Uses HAVEN as their primary digital companion
3.2 Secondary User — The Family Member / Mantelzorger
Age: 35–60
Grown child or partner of the elder
Dutch or English-speaking
Uses the family dashboard on mobile and desktop
Legally a "mantelzorger" (informal carer) in the Dutch care context
3.3 Tertiary User — The Professional Carer / Zorgverlener
Home care worker (thuiszorgmedewerker) or district nurse (wijkverpleegkundige)
Works within a licensed zorginstelling
Uses the Guardian portal (role-scoped)
Operates under BIG-register obligations and WGBO
4. The Six Pillars
Pillar 1 — SCHILD (Fraud & Scam Protection)
Dutch elders are specifically targeted by "bankhelpdeskfraude" (fake bank helpdesk calls), "vriend-in-nood" (friend-in-need WhatsApp scams), and fake overheid (government) portals.

Features:

Real-time call reputation analysis
Multi-layer scam scoring pipeline (per-call, per-message, per-link)
Conversation coaching during a flagged live call ("stay on the line, this may be a scam")
Document Vault (SCHILD): Securely store and label important documents — such as insurance policies, medication overviews, wills, and utility contracts.

  Explicit exclusions (displayed in UI):
  - Do not upload documents showing your full BSN. If you wish to store an identity document, redact the BSN number before uploading.
  - HAVEN does not process or read BSN numbers and cannot validate identity documents.
  - DigiD integration: DigiD is explicitly out of scope for MVP. Any future DigiD integration (e.g. for MedMij access) requires a separate legal basis assessment and technical security review before implementation.
[Phase 2 — PSD2 transaction intercept] Transaction intercept for flagged anomalies (via PSD2 Open Banking APIs)
Alert levels: Amber (worth knowing) → Rood (take action) → Zwart (transaction blocked)
Social engineering memory: tracks escalating "grooming" patterns across time
Weekly "Veiligheidsoverzicht" (safety digest) for family
Pillar 2 — ANKER (Health, Meds, Daily Rhythm)
Medication setup via photo/OCR of Dutch "bijsluiter" (medication leaflet) and geneesmiddelen labels
Warm voice reminders with escalation after misses
Daily rhythm board ("Vandaag")
Voice task manager
Wellness check-ins
~~G-standaard/Z-index integration~~ *(Phase 3 — not MVP, not Phase 2)*

> **Phase label rule:** G-standaard requires an AGB-code and a formal Vecozo/ZIN 
> agreement. This is out of scope until HAVEN is a registered healthcare application.
MedMij/PGO integration for Dutch personal health record access
Huisarts (GP) appointment reminders
Pillar 3 — KRING (Connection & Community)
Family messaging: text, voice notes, photos, video hellos
Life story archive ("Mijn Verhaal") with Whisper transcription
Memory lane: anniversary and memorial surfacing
Dutch community event aggregation (via gemeentelijke APIs and Ouderenfonds feeds)
Intergenerational skill exchange
Connection to Dutch elder networks (ANBO, KBO-PCOB)

### KRING — sub-feature: BUURT (De Buurtverbinder) [MVP Phase 2]

**Problem:** 51% of Dutch adults aged 75+ feel lonely (RIVM/Buurtteam Amsterdam 2024).
Neighbourhood spaces are the most accessible social space for ageing-in-place elders,
but there is no low-friction, privacy-safe way to discover shared interests nearby.

**What it does:**
- Opt-in neighbourhood profile with Dutch interest tags (no name, no photo required)
- Anonymous proximity display ("3 mensen in uw buurt gebruiken ook HAVEN")
- Interest-matching without identity disclosure
- Hyper-local activity suggestions (library events, park walks, etc.)
- "Wandelmaatje" — mutual opt-in walk-buddy matching
- Anonymous connection requests → double opt-in before any contact

**What it does NOT do:**
- No real-time location sharing
- No direct messaging
- No demographic matching
- No visible profiles until both parties consent

**Phase assignment:** Phase 2 (post-MVP closed beta)
**Feature flag:** buurt_neighbourhood_connector (default: false)
Pillar 4 — KOMPAS (Cognitive Safety & Orientation)
Daily cognitive check-ins (orientation questions)
Safe zone / "Veilige Zone" — PostGIS-backed with fuzzy location privacy
"Wat is dit?" — photo explainer (camera → AI → plain Dutch description)
Rouw- en verliesondersteuning (grief/bereavement mode)
Emergency medical profile (for huisarts and ambulance)
Nachtmodus (night safety mode)
Wandering detection via optional integration with GPS wearables
Pillar 5 — STEM (The Voice Companion)
Persistent-memory Dutch-language companion
Offline fallback for core interactions
Crisis phrase detection ("ik voel me niet goed", "ik ben bang")
Warm, calm Dutch voice persona (ElevenLabs, nl-NL voice)
Pillar 6 — WACHT (Professional Care Portal)
Role-scoped portal for thuiszorg and wijkverpleging
Visit logs and care plan hub
Safeguarding incident reporting (meldcode Huiselijk Geweld)
Integration with Careweb / ONS / Nedap care systems (Phase 2)
5. MVP Definition
The MVP is the smallest safe, loveable product that can be delivered to a closed beta of 50 Dutch elder households within 6 months.

Document 02 — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Each ADR follows the format: Context → Decision → Rationale → Consequences → Alternatives Rejected

ADR-001 — Primary Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Context: We need a backend that provides auth, database, storage, real-time, and edge compute with minimal operational overhead for a small team.

Decision: Supabase hosted on AWS eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) as the primary backend.

Rationale:

EU region hosting satisfies AVG/GDPR data residency requirements
PostgreSQL is the most mature open-source relational DB; we need ACID transactions for health and financial data
Supabase provides Row-Level Security natively, which is architecturally central to HAVEN's consent model
pgvector and PostGIS are first-class Postgres extensions — no additional vector or geo database needed at MVP scale
Supabase Auth provides JWT-based auth with RLS integration out of the box
Edge Functions (Deno) run in the same region as the DB, minimising latency for sensitive operations
Consequences:

We are partially vendor-locked to Supabase's hosting; mitigation is that the underlying stack is standard PostgreSQL + open-source
At very high scale (>500k active users) we will need to evaluate dedicated Postgres hosting
Alternatives Rejected:

Firebase: No native SQL, no RLS, US-centric data residency by default, no pgvector
AWS Amplify: High operational complexity, harder RLS model, more infrastructure overhead
Custom Node.js + RDS: Too much boilerplate for a small team at this stage
ADR-002 — Elder Mobile App: React Native + Expo
Context: We need a cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android targeting Dutch elders (predominantly iOS via families gifting iPads, but Android significant in lower-income demographics).

Decision: React Native with Expo (Managed Workflow → Bare when needed).

Rationale:

Single codebase for iOS and Android
Expo's accessibility APIs are mature
EAS Build integrates with CI/CD
Large ecosystem for the integrations we need (HealthKit, Notifications, Camera/OCR)
Schema-driven UI renderer is framework-agnostic in principle but React Native's component model fits the declarative schema pattern well
Consequences:

Some native modules require ejecting to bare workflow (e.g., advanced Bluetooth for wearables in Phase 2)
React Native bridge overhead exists but is acceptable for our use case (not a high-frame-rate game)
Alternatives Rejected:

Flutter: Smaller ecosystem for our specific integrations; team expertise is React-based
Native iOS/Android: 2x development cost; unjustifiable for MVP
PWA: Insufficient access to native APIs (microphone, HealthKit, haptics, background tasks)
ADR-003 — Family Dashboard: Next.js 14 (App Router)
Context: Family members and carers need a web dashboard that works on desktop and mobile browsers.

Decision: Next.js 14 with App Router, hosted on Vercel (EU region).

Rationale:

App Router enables Server Components — sensitive data is never sent to client unnecessarily
Vercel EU region (Frankfurt) for data residency
Supabase Auth works seamlessly with Next.js middleware for SSR auth
Real-time dashboard updates via Supabase Realtime subscriptions on the client
Alternatives Rejected:

SvelteKit: Less team familiarity; smaller ecosystem for our UI component needs
Remix: Good option but App Router now has equivalent capabilities
Standalone React SPA: Loses SSR benefits; SEO not relevant here but SSR auth security model is important
ADR-004 — Voice STT: OpenAI Whisper (API)
Context: Speech-to-text for Dutch elder voices, which may include accents, slower speech, and softer articulation.

Decision: OpenAI Whisper via API (whisper-1 model) with language: nl forced.

Rationale:

Whisper has best-in-class Dutch language support including regional accents
Forcing language: nl improves accuracy and reduces hallucination on Dutch speech
API model removes on-device compute requirement for MVP
OpenAI processes data under a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) — we have confirmed EU DPA availability
Consequences:

Voice audio is sent to OpenAI servers; this is a data residency consideration. Mitigation: DPA in place; audio is not stored by OpenAI after transcription; elder consent is explicit during onboarding
Latency: API round-trip ~300–800ms acceptable for our use case
Phase 2 Consideration: Evaluate on-device Whisper (via whisper.rn or ExpoSpeech) for offline fallback.

Alternatives Rejected:

Azure Cognitive Services Speech: Dutch quality inferior to Whisper in testing
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Similar quality but higher cost at scale; less flexible
AssemblyAI: No strong nl-NL support
ADR-005 — Voice TTS: ElevenLabs
Context: Text-to-speech for the STEM voice companion must sound warm, calm, and natural in Dutch — not robotic.

Decision: ElevenLabs API with a custom nl-NL voice persona ("Hanna" — warm, measured, 60s-female-presenting voice).

Rationale:

ElevenLabs produces the most natural-sounding Dutch TTS available as of 2026
Custom voice cloning allows us to design a consistent HAVEN persona
Streaming API supports low-latency first-byte delivery
ElevenLabs GDPR DPA available
Consequences:

Cost scales with character volume; see Document 10 for cost model
Voice persona must be carefully designed to avoid being mistaken for a real person (AVG Article 22 / transparency obligation)
Alternatives Rejected:

Azure TTS (nl-NL): Good but less warm; "uncanny valley" effect in user testing
Google Cloud TTS: Similar issue
On-device TTS: Quality insufficient for our dignity-first positioning
ADR-006 — Vector Storage: pgvector (in Supabase Postgres)
Context: Companion memory, scam event similarity search, and life story retrieval require semantic vector search.

Decision: pgvector extension within Supabase Postgres; HNSW index for ANN search.

Rationale:

Keeps the data plane unified — no separate vector database to manage, secure, or pay for
HNSW index (added in pgvector 0.5+) provides performance adequate for our scale (< 5M vectors at 5-year horizon)
Simplifies RLS: vector search respects the same row-level security as all other queries
Consequences:

At very large scale (10M+ vectors) we will need to evaluate Qdrant or Pinecone. That is a Phase 3+ concern.
Alternatives Rejected:

Pinecone: Separate service, separate security model, no RLS, US-hosted by default
Qdrant: Self-hosted operational complexity; overkill for MVP
ADR-007 — Location: PostGIS with Fuzzy Privacy Model
Context: Safe zone and wandering detection require geospatial data. But storing precise elder location is a significant privacy risk.

Decision: PostGIS extension in Postgres. Location is stored as neighbourhood-level fuzzed geometry (100m radius noise applied before storage) except for active safe-zone exit events (stored precisely, auto-deleted after 24h).

Rationale:

Fuzzy location satisfies our dignity-first principle: HAVEN is not a tracking app
PostGIS integrates natively with Postgres RLS
Neighbourhood-level precision is sufficient for "left the safe zone" detection and community event matching
Consequences:

Precise route history is never stored (intentional)
store precise location only for active "safe-zone exit" handling,
then automatically null it after **24 hours** (enforced by pg_cron).

**TTL canonical value: 24 hours — this is the single source of truth.**
- ADR-007 (this record): 24h ✅
- location_events.auto_delete_at comment: 24h ✅
- pg_cron job 'null-precise-location': 24h ✅
- Canonical retention table: 24h ✅
- Addendum J DPIA risk table: 24h ✅

Rationale for 24h (not 48h):
The shorter window minimises re-identification risk while providing enough
time for the family alert flow to complete (SLO: notification within 15s
of event; family action typically within hours). 24h was chosen over 48h
to align with the "minimal retention" principle under AVG Art. 5(1)(e).
ADR-008 — PSD2 Banking Integration (Phase 2)
Context: Transaction anomaly detection requires read access to elder banking data.

Decision: Use a Dutch PSD2 AISP (Account Information Service Provider) aggregator. Target: Tink (EU-licensed, GDPR-compliant) or Nordigen (now Gocardless). Final vendor selected at Phase 2 start.

Rationale:

PSD2 gives us a legal framework for read-only account access with explicit elder consent
Dutch major banks (ING, Rabobank, ABN AMRO) all expose PSD2-compliant APIs
AISP aggregators handle the bank-by-bank OAuth flows and normalise the data
Consequences:

Elder must explicitly consent via their bank's OAuth flow (strong customer authentication)
We never store full account numbers — only masked identifiers and transaction metadata
ADR-009 — Dutch Healthcare Integration: MedMij / PGO (Phase 2)
Context: Accessing Dutch personal health records requires compliance with the MedMij standard.

Decision: Integrate with a certified Dutch PGO (Persoonlijke Gezondheidsomgeving) provider as a data consumer, using the MedMij afsprakenstelsel (framework agreement).

Rationale:

MedMij is the Dutch national standard for personal health data exchange
Integrating as a MedMij data consumer gives us legally compliant access to medication history, GP correspondence, and lab results
Requires formal MedMij toelating (accreditation) — this is a Phase 2 regulatory milestone
Consequences:

MedMij accreditation takes 3–6 months; must be started at Phase 1 end
FHIR R4 is the underlying data format
ADR-010 — Embedding Model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
Context: Companion memory, scam similarity, and story retrieval require embeddings.

Decision: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions).

Rationale:

Strong multilingual performance including Dutch
Cost-effective vs. text-embedding-3-large
1536 dimensions work well with pgvector HNSW
Consequences:

All text sent for embedding is subject to OpenAI DPA (same as Whisper)

### ADR-011 — DigiD integration: DEFERRED (Phase 3+)
**Decision:** DigiD integration is explicitly deferred. It does not appear in
any onboarding flow, document vault feature, or MedMij integration spec until
this ADR is resolved.

**Why deferred:**
- DigiD requires BSN as the underlying identifier (HAVEN does not collect BSN — ADR-008)
- DigiD integration requires a formal Logius agreement (aansluitovereenkomst)
- DigiD requires NEN 7510 / ISO 27001 certification which HAVEN does not yet hold
- MedMij PGO integration (Phase 2) can use alternative authentication
  (ZORGID, IRMA/Yivi) without DigiD — these will be evaluated in Phase 2 ADR

**Pre-conditions before this ADR can be re-opened:**
1. Legal basis for BSN processing confirmed by counsel
2. Logius aansluitovereenkomst negotiations initiated
3. NEN 7510 certification scope assessment complete
4. DPO sign-off on expanded DPIA scope

Document 04 — API Contract
1. Authentication Model
HAVEN uses Supabase Auth (JWT) with three roles enforced at the database level via RLS.

1.1 Roles
Role	Description	Auth Method
elder	Primary app user	Magic link SMS (no password)
family	Family member / mantelzorger	Email + password (Phase 2)
carer	Professional zorgverlener	Email + password + organisation invite
admin	HAVEN platform admin	Email + password + TOTP mandatory
1.2 JWT Claims
Every JWT issued by Supabase Auth includes:

JSON

{
  "sub": "<uuid>",
  "role": "authenticated",
  "app_role": "family",
  "elder_id": "<uuid>",
  "org_id": "<uuid | null>",
  "iat": 1718000000,
  "exp": 1718086400
}
app_role is set via a Supabase Auth hook that reads from the profiles table on sign-in. elder_id is set for family and carer roles to the primary elder they are linked to.

1.3 Token Lifecycle
Token	Lifetime	Storage
Access token	1 hour	In-memory only (never localStorage, never AsyncStorage unencrypted)
Refresh token	30 days	iOS Keychain / Android Keystore via expo-secure-store
2. Edge Functions — Complete Inventory
All Edge Functions are deployed to supabase/functions/ and run in Deno on Supabase Edge Runtime (eu-central-1).

2.1 fn-voice-pipeline
Trigger: POST from elder app Auth: Bearer JWT (elder role required) Input:

TypeScript

{
  audio_base64: string;       // 16kHz mono WAV, max 30s
  screen_id: ScreenId;        // current screen context
  elder_id: string;           // UUID
}
Output:

TypeScript

{
  transcript: string;
  intent: IntentType;
  entities: Record<string, string>;
  response_text: string;
  audio_url: string;          // signed Supabase Storage URL, 5-min TTL
  action_taken: ActionType | null;
  distress_detected: boolean;
}
Side effects: INSERTs to voice_interactions; may INSERT to tasks, wellness_checkins, life_stories; may trigger fn-notification-dispatch if distress detected.

2.2 fn-scam-pipeline
Trigger: POST from elder app (call event or message event) or scheduled via pg_cron Auth: Bearer JWT (elder role) or service role (for scheduled jobs) Input:

TypeScript

{
  elder_id: string;
  channel: 'phone' | 'sms' | 'whatsapp' | 'email' | 'web';
  signal_reference: string;   // phone number (hashed) or URL or message snippet hash
  raw_content_hash: string;   // SHA-256 of raw content — content itself not stored
  contact_id?: string;        // UUID if known contact
}
Output:

TypeScript

{
  scam_event_id: string;
  alert_level: 'none' | 'amber' | 'rood' | 'zwart';
  composite_score: number;    // 0–100
  layer_scores: {
    reputation: number;
    pattern: number;
    nlp_intent: number;
    longitudinal: number;
  };
  explanation_nl: string;     // Dutch plain-language explanation for elder
  family_notified: boolean;
}
2.3 fn-medication-escalation
Trigger: pg_cron every 10 minutes Auth: Service role Logic: Queries medication_reminders where status IN ('reminded', 'snoozed_1', 'snoozed_2') and scheduled_time < now() - escalation_threshold. Updates status, dispatches notifications. Output: No HTTP response (scheduled job); side effects only.

2.4 fn-companion-memory
Trigger: Called internally by fn-voice-pipeline Auth: Service role Input:

TypeScript

{
  elder_id: string;
  interaction_id: string;
  memory_type: 'personal_fact' | 'preference' | 'recurring_event' | 'life_event' | 'emotional_state' | 'medical_context';
  content: string;
  source_interaction_id?: string;
  source_story_id?: string;
}
Logic: Generates embedding via OpenAI → upserts to companion_memory (deduplication via cosine similarity threshold 0.97).

2.5 fn-notification-dispatch
Trigger: Called by other Edge Functions Auth: Service role Input:

TypeScript

{
  recipient_id: string;
  recipient_role: 'elder' | 'family' | 'carer';
  notification_type: NotificationType;
  title_nl: string;
  body_nl: string;
  data?: Record<string, string>;
  priority: 'normal' | 'high';
}
Logic: Looks up push_tokens for recipient → dispatches via Expo Push API (which routes to APNs/FCM). INSERTs to notifications table.

2.6 fn-weekly-digest
Trigger: pg_cron every Monday 08:00 Europe/Amsterdam Auth: Service role Logic: Aggregates prior 7 days of scam_events, medication_reminders, wellness_checkins, voice_interactions per elder → INSERTs to safety_digests → dispatches push/email to linked family members.

2.7 fn-transaction-intercept (Phase 2)
Trigger: Webhook from PSD2/Tink on new transaction Auth: Tink webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256) Input: Tink transaction payload (normalised) Logic: Runs anomaly scoring → if score > threshold, INSERTs financial_transactions with flagged = true, creates linked scam_event, dispatches fn-notification-dispatch at zwart level.

2.8 fn-location-event
Trigger: POST from elder app (background location update) Auth: Bearer JWT (elder role) Input:

TypeScript

{
  elder_id: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy_metres: number;
  timestamp: string;          // ISO 8601
}
Logic:

Apply 100m fuzzy noise before storage
Check against elder_profiles.safe_zone_centre + safe_zone_radius_metres
If outside safe zone (safe-zone exit): INSERT location_events with precise geometry (and fuzzed geometry), setting auto_delete_at = now() + 24 hours (canonical TTL).

2.9 fn-buurt-discover
Trigger: POST from elder app
Auth: Bearer JWT (elder role)
Input:
```typescript
interface BuurtDiscoverInput {
  elder_id: string;
}
```
Output:
```typescript
interface BuurtDiscoverOutput {
  nearby_haven_users_count: number;       // e.g. 3 — NEVER identities
  shared_interest_matches: Array<{
    tag_key: string;
    label_nl: string;
    nearby_count: number;                 // e.g. "2 mensen houden ook van tuinieren"
  }>;
  suggested_events: Array<{
    id: string;
    title_nl: string;
    location_label_nl: string;
    distance_label_nl: string;
    event_date: string;
    is_free: boolean;
    interested_count: number;             // how many other HAVEN users marked interest
  }>;
  walk_buddy_available: boolean;          // is there someone seeking a walk buddy nearby?
}
```
Privacy rule: this function MUST query using PC4 matching only. It MUST NOT return `elder_id`, `profile_id`, or any identifier of another elder under any circumstances.

2.10 fn-buurt-match
Trigger: POST from elder app
Auth: Bearer JWT (elder role)
Input:
```typescript
interface BuurtMatchInput {
  action:
    | 'send_request'
    | 'accept_request'
    | 'decline_request'
    | 'withdraw_request'
    | 'end_connection';
  connection_id?: string;         // required for all actions except 'send_request'
  shared_tag_ids?: string[];      // required for 'send_request'
  is_walk_buddy?: boolean;
}
```
Output:
```typescript
interface BuurtMatchOutput {
  success: boolean;
  new_status: ConnectionStatus;
  message_nl: string;             // e.g. "Uw verzoek is verstuurd."
}
```
Privacy rule: when `action = 'send_request'`, the function selects a matching recipient using PC4 + shared tags — **it does NOT expose the recipient's ID to the initiator** until `status = 'accepted'` by both parties.

2.11 fn-buurt-events-ingest
Trigger: POST (scheduled / admin)
Auth: Service role only
Input:
```typescript
interface EventIngestInput {
  events: Array<{
    postcode_pc4: string;
    location_label_nl: string;
    distance_label_nl: string;
    title_nl: string;
    description_nl?: string;
    event_date: string;           // ISO date
    event_time?: string;          // HH:MM
    is_free: boolean;
    relevant_tag_keys: string[];  // maps to tag_ids on insert
    source: string;
    source_url?: string;
  }>;
}
```

3. PostgREST (Auto-generated REST API)
Supabase exposes all tables via PostgREST. Access is governed entirely by RLS policies (defined in Document 05). No table is accessible without a valid JWT and a matching RLS policy.

Key conventions:

All list endpoints use ?limit=50&offset=0 pagination by default
Soft-deleted rows (deleted_at IS NOT NULL) are filtered by RLS policy — callers never see them
Timestamps are always UTC ISO 8601; UI converts to Europe/Amsterdam for display
4. Real-time Subscriptions
The family dashboard and elder app use Supabase Realtime for live updates.

Channel	Table	Filter	Used By
scam-alerts	scam_events	elder_id = :id AND alert_level IN ('rood','zwart')	Family dashboard
medication-status	medication_reminders	elder_id = :id	Family dashboard
family-messages	family_messages	elder_id = :id	Elder app + family dashboard
notifications	notifications	recipient_id = :id	Both apps
location-events	location_events	elder_id = :id AND event_type = 'safe_zone_exit'	Family dashboard
All channels are authenticated — Supabase Realtime validates the JWT before subscribing and RLS applies to the underlying data.

1. Principles
All tables have UUID primary keys (gen_random_uuid())
All tables have created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() and updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
All tables support soft delete via deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
RLS enabled on every table with explicit FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY
updated_at maintained via moddatetime trigger on all tables
All migrations are versioned SQL files in supabase/migrations/
Migration naming: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql
2. Extensions

12. RLS Policy Definitions

## 🔴 CANONICAL RLS SOURCE — READ THIS FIRST

The **authoritative, complete, production-ready RLS policy SQL** for all tables
is defined in **Addendum A** (`docs/addenda/A-rls-policies.md`).

The policy examples shown in this section (Doc 05) are **illustrative summaries
only** — they exist to explain the access-control philosophy, not to be
implemented directly.

**Engineer rule:** When implementing or auditing RLS, use ONLY Addendum A.
If Doc 05 and Addendum A ever conflict, **Addendum A wins**.

Last reconciliation check: 2026-06-10 ✅

These are illustrative RLS policy examples only. All are PERMISSIVE unless stated.

Document 06 — Security & Compliance
1. Regulatory Framework (Netherlands)
Regulation	Relevance to HAVEN	Owner
AVG (Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming = GDPR)	Primary data protection law. All personal data processing must have a legal basis.	CTO + DPO
Uitvoeringswet AVG (UAVG)	Dutch implementation of GDPR with supplementary rules	CTO + DPO
WGBO (Wet op de geneeskundige behandelingsovereenkomst)	Governs medical data handling; relevant for medication, health, and care data	CTO + Legal
WMO (Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning)	Governs home care and social support services; relevant for WACHT pillar	Product + Legal
Meldcode Huiselijk Geweld en Kindermishandeling	Governs incident reporting obligations for professional carers	WACHT module
NEN 7510	Dutch standard for information security in healthcare	Security team
MedMij Afsprakenstelsel	Framework for personal health data exchange (Phase 2)	Phase 2 CTO
PSD2 / PSD3	Payment services directive; governs banking data access	Phase 2 (SCHILD)
ePrivacy Directive (Dutch implementation)	Governs cookies, electronic communications, push notifications	Frontend
2. Legal Bases for Processing (AVG Article 6 + Article 9)
HAVEN processes multiple categories of data. Each requires an explicit legal basis.

Data Category	AVG Article 9 Special Category?	Legal Basis	Notes
Name, contact details, profile	No	Article 6(1)(b) — contract performance	Core service delivery
Voice recordings (STEM)	No (unless health content)	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Consent captured on onboarding; withdrawable at any time
Medication data	Yes — health data	Article 9(2)(a) — explicit consent	Must be granular and informed
BSN (Burgerservicenummer)	Forbidden to collect	Not stored, not processed, not transmitted. UI warns users not to upload documents containing unredacted BSN.
Location data	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Consent per-family-member; elder can revoke
Financial transaction data (Phase 2)	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	PSD2 consent flow required
Health check-ins / wellness	Yes — health data	Article 9(2)(a) — explicit consent	
Cognitive check-in scores	Yes — health data	Article 9(2)(a) — explicit consent	
Life stories / voice diaries	No (unless health content)	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Elder controls sharing
Scam event data	No	Article 6(1)(f) — legitimate interest	Fraud prevention; LIA documented
Neighbourhood profile	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Opt-in required
Interest tags	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Selected from curated catalogue
PC4 neighbourhood	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Declared by elder; not real-time location
Name reveal (double opt-in)	No	Article 6(1)(a) — explicit consent	Double opt-in is the consent mechanism
Carer visit logs	Yes — health data	Article 9(2)(h) — healthcare provision	Carer professional obligation
Incident reports	Yes — health data	Article 9(2)(h) + Meldcode obligations	
3. Consent Management
3.1 Consent Principles
Consent is granular — separate consent for each data category (not bundled)
Consent is recorded — stored in consent_records table (see below) with timestamp, version, and channel
Consent is withdrawable — at any time via elder app settings; withdrawal triggers immediate processing halt + soft deletion where applicable
Consent language is plain Dutch — maximum 8th-grade reading level; no legal jargon
Consent for health data requires a separate explicit confirmation step (double-tap or voice "ja, ik ga akkoord")
3.2 consent_records Table
SQL

CREATE TABLE consent_records (
  id                    UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  elder_id              UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
  consent_type          TEXT NOT NULL,    -- e.g., 'voice_recordings', 'medication_data'
  granted               BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  consent_version       TEXT NOT NULL,    -- e.g., 'v1.2'
  channel               TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'elder_app', 'family_onboarding', 'api'
  ip_address_hashed     TEXT,
  device_id             TEXT,
  granted_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  withdrawn_at          TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- consent_records
ALTER TABLE consent_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE consent_records FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "consent_records: elder access"
  ON consent_records FOR ALL
  USING (elder_id = auth.uid());
4. Data Classification
Class	Definition	Examples	Controls
Class 1 — Openbaar	Non-personal, non-sensitive	App UI text, community event data	Standard
Class 2 — Persoonlijk	Personal data (AVG Article 4)	Name, phone, email, push tokens	Encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3), RLS enforced
Class 3 — Gevoelig Persoonlijk	Sensitive personal data	Location, financial, scam events	Class 2 controls + field-level encryption where feasible
Class 4 — Bijzondere Categorie (AVG Art. 9)	Health-adjacent data (medications, wellness, cognitive check-ins), precise location (transient, 24h), voice recordings (transient, 30d), crisis/distress signals, bereavement state	Class 3 controls + explicit consent + access audit log + encryption at rest (AES-256)

---
> ⚠️ **BSN is NOT in Class 4 — it is in Class 5 (Forbidden to collect).**
> See the BSN hard rule below. Do not place BSN in any "storable" data class.
---

Class 5 — Verboden te verzamelen	BSN (Burgerservicenummer) — HAVEN does not collect, store, process, or transmit BSN under any circumstances. This is a hard product rule enforced at schema, UI, Edge Function, and vendor contract level. See ADR-008 and Doc 06 BSN section.	Forbidden to collect
5. Encryption
5.1 In Transit
All API traffic: TLS 1.3 minimum
WebSocket (Realtime): WSS with TLS 1.3
Internal Supabase service communication: encrypted by Supabase platform
5.2 At Rest
Supabase hosted PostgreSQL: AES-256 disk encryption (AWS EBS)
Supabase Storage: AES-256 (AWS S3)
(No BSN field — HAVEN does not store BSN. See BSN hard product rule below.)
Voice recordings: encrypted at storage path level via Supabase Storage (AES-256); paths are not guessable (UUID-based)
5.3 Key Management
Application secrets: Supabase Vault
Service role key: never exposed to frontend; only used in Edge Functions server-side
(No BSN encryption key — BSN is not stored or processed. See BSN hard product rule below.)
5.4 BSN — Not Processed (Hard Product Rule)

HAVEN does not collect, store, or process BSN.
This is a hard product rule enforced at:
  - DB schema level (no BSN columns)
  - UI level (vault upload warning)
  - Data classification level (Class 4 — forbidden to collect)
  - Vendor contract level (vendors must not receive BSN from HAVEN)

If any integration partner requests BSN transmission, this must be escalated
to the DPO immediately and rejected unless a specific statutory basis is confirmed.

6. Threat Model
6.1 Assets to Protect
Elder personal and health data (Class 4)
Family member access credentials
Voice recordings and life stories
Companion memory (persistent personal history)
Financial data (Phase 2)
Healthcare identifiers (zorgverzekering nummer, huisarts contact) — BSN is not stored (hard product rule)
6.2 Threat Actors
Actor	Motivation	Capability
Opportunistic attacker	Financial gain via elder data	Low-medium
Targeted scammer	Access to elder's financial/identity data to facilitate fraud	Medium
Compromised family member	Misuse of elder monitoring capabilities	Low
Malicious carer	Unauthorised access to elder personal data	Low-medium
HAVEN insider	Unauthorised data access	Medium
State actor	Data espionage	Low (not a target at this scale)
6.3 Attack Surfaces
Surface	Threat	Mitigation
Elder app (mobile)	Stolen device → app access	Biometric/PIN lock required; tokens in Keychain; no sensitive data in AsyncStorage
Elder app (mobile)	Malicious app update	Expo EAS signed builds; code signing
Family dashboard (web)	XSS	Next.js App Router (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML); CSP headers
Family dashboard (web)	CSRF	SameSite=Strict cookies; CSRF tokens on state-changing requests
Supabase API	Unauthorised data access	RLS on all tables; service role key never in frontend
Edge Functions	Injection via malformed audio/text	Input validation + sanitisation on all Edge Function inputs
Push notifications	Spoofed notifications	Notifications only sent server-side via service role
PSD2 webhooks (Phase 2)	Spoofed webhook	HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on all inbound webhooks
BSN	Not collected	N/A — HAVEN does not store BSN (hard product rule; see Section 5.4)

7.1 Right to Erasure Process
Elder or authorised family member submits deletion request (in-app or email to privacy@haven.nl)
Request logged in deletion_requests table with timestamp
Automated pipeline runs within 72 hours: cascades soft deletes, nulls encrypted fields, removes Storage files
Confirmation sent to elder within 30 days (AVG Article 12(3))
Any legally retained data (carer logs, financial records) listed explicitly in the confirmation
8. Audit Logging
All access to Class 3/4 data is logged in an append-only audit table.

SQL

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,               -- sequential for ordering
  actor_id        UUID NOT NULL,
  actor_role      user_role NOT NULL,
  action          TEXT NOT NULL,                       -- e.g., 'READ', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
  table_name      TEXT NOT NULL,
  record_id       UUID NOT NULL,
  elder_id        UUID,
  ip_address_hash TEXT,
  user_agent      TEXT,
  extra           JSONB,
  created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- No RLS delete policy — audit_log is append-only
-- Only service role can INSERT
-- Retention: 7 years (legal obligation)
Audit events are triggered via Supabase database triggers on:

elder_profiles (all operations)
medications (all operations)
scam_events (all operations)
financial_transactions (all operations)
documents (all operations)
companion_memory (read events via Edge Function logging)
consent_records (all operations)
9. AVG / GDPR Operational Obligations
Obligation	Implementation
Privacy by Design	Schema-driven UI prevents accidental data collection; fuzzed location; no raw audio stored beyond 30 days
Data Minimisation	Only data necessary for each feature is collected; fields for Phase 2 features are nullable and not populated
Verwerkingsregister (Article 30 Record of Processing)	Maintained as living document in Notion; reviewed quarterly
DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)	Required for voice recordings, location, and health data. Completed before MVP launch. (BSN is not processed — no BSN-specific DPIA scope.)
Privacy Policy (Privacyverklaring)	Available in plain Dutch at haven.nl/privacy; version-controlled
Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens Registration	Not mandatory unless processing meets Article 37 DPO threshold; assessed at launch
Data Breach Notification	Within 72 hours to AP (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) per AVG Article 33; within "without undue delay" to affected elders per Article 34
DPA with Supabase	In place (Supabase EU DPA)
DPA with OpenAI	In place (OpenAI Data Processing Addendum for EU customers)
DPA with ElevenLabs	Required — confirm EU DPA availability before launch
DPA with Expo/Vercel	In place (both offer EU DPAs)
10. Security Review Plan
Review Type	Frequency	Owner
Dependency vulnerability scan (Snyk)	Every CI run	Automated
Static code analysis (ESLint security rules)	Every CI run	Automated
Supabase RLS policy review	Each schema migration	CTO
Internal security review	Quarterly	CTO
External penetration test	Before MVP launch + annually	Third-party (NEN 7510 certified firm)
AVG compliance review	Annually	DPO + Legal
Document 07 — Elder App Specification
1. Overview
The elder app is a React Native (Expo) application. Its central engineering bet is that every screen is a data schema and the UI is built by a renderer from that schema. This makes it structurally impossible to accidentally add complexity — any screen that violates the UX constitution will fail the CI test suite.

2. UX Constitution (Enforced in CI)
These rules are non-negotiable and tested automatically:

Rule	Constraint
Max navigation depth from home	≤ 2 levels
Max primary items per screen	≤ 4
Max bottom actions per screen	≤ 2
Voice fallback	Required on every screen; ≤ 15 words
Offline cache TTL	Required on every screen
Emergency button	Required on all screens except modals
Accessibility label	Required on every interactive element
Banned words (deceptive/scary)	fout, mislukt, waarschuwing, gevaar, ongeldig, fout opgetreden; "Ik ben een echte medewerker", "Ik ben geen computer", "U spreekt met een persoon" (EU AI Act Art. 50 — deceptive identity claims banned; AI disclosure required)
Banned words (SCHILD exception)	"Nooit" is allowed on SCHILD screens only
Font size	Minimum 18sp body; minimum 24sp primary actions
Touch targets	Minimum 56×56dp
Colour contrast	WCAG 2.1 AA minimum; AAA for primary text

Document 08 — Family Dashboard Specification
1. Overview
The family dashboard is a Next.js 14 (App Router) web application hosted on Vercel (EU region). It is the primary interface for family members (mantelzorgers) to stay connected with their elder, monitor wellbeing, and respond to alerts.

The dashboard is role-aware — what a primary family member sees differs from a secondary family member, based on the permissions granted in family_relationships.

2. Screen Inventory
Screen	Route	Access	Description
Login	/inloggen	Public	Email/password login
Dashboard Home	/dashboard	Family	Overview: halo, alerts, quick actions
Alerts	/dashboard/meldingen	Family	All scam alerts, medication misses, zone exits
Alert Detail	/dashboard/meldingen/[id]	Family	Full scam event details + pipeline scores
Medications	/dashboard/medicijnen	Family (can_view_medications)	Today's status + history
Messages	/dashboard/berichten	Family (can_view_messages)	Send/read family messages
Stories	/dashboard/verhalen	Family (can_view_stories)	Life story archive (read-only)
Wellness	/dashboard/welzijn	Family (can_view_wellness)	Wellness trends + check-in history
Location	/dashboard/locatie	Family (can_view_location)	Fuzzed map: safe zone + last known area
Buurt Connections	/dashboard/buurt	Family (can_view_stories + consent)	Neighbourhood connections overview
Weekly Digest	/dashboard/overzicht	Family	Weekly safety + wellbeing summary
Elder Profile	/dashboard/profiel	Primary family only	Edit elder profile, manage permissions
Medications Setup	/dashboard/medicijnen/beheren	Primary + can_manage_medications	Add/edit medications
Safe Zone Setup	/dashboard/locatie/zone	Primary + can_manage_safe_zone	Edit safe zone on map
Settings	/dashboard/instellingen	Family	Notification preferences, account
3. Halo Status Component
The halo is the primary "how is mum/dad doing today" indicator on the dashboard home. It maps to the same three-axis model in the elder app.

Axis	Colour	Logic
Pillen (green/amber/red)	Green	All medications taken today
Amber	Some missed; not yet escalated
Red	Escalated; family notification sent
Veiligheid (green/amber/red)	Green	No scam events in 7 days
Amber	Amber scam event in last 24h
Red	Rood or Zwart event in last 24h
Familie (green/amber/grey)	Green	Message exchanged in last 48h
Grey	No family interaction in 7+ days
4. Real-time Alert Experience
When an alert arrives:

Browser push notification (if tab not active)
In-app toast notification (if tab active): Supabase Realtime subscription
Dashboard halo status updates live
Alert appears at top of /dashboard/meldingen
Alert tone by level:

Level	Visual	Sound	Action Required
Amber	Soft orange banner	Gentle chime	No — informational
Rood	Orange/red card, pulse animation	Alert tone	Yes — review recommended
Zwart	Full-screen intercept overlay	Urgent tone	Yes — immediate review required
5. Permission-Scoped Views
The dashboard checks family_relationships permissions on every sensitive page via Next.js middleware:

TypeScript

// middleware.ts (simplified)
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { session } = await getSession(request);
  const { data: relationship } = await supabase
    .from('family_relationships')
    .select('*')
    .eq('family_member_id', session.user.id)
    .single();

  const PERMISSION_MAP: Record<string, keyof FamilyRelationship> = {
    '/dashboard/medicijnen': 'can_view_medications',
    '/dashboard/locatie': 'can_view_location',
    '/dashboard/verhalen': 'can_view_stories',
    '/dashboard/welzijn': 'can_view_wellness',
  };

  const requiredPermission = PERMISSION_MAP[request.nextUrl.pathname];
  if (requiredPermission && !relationship[requiredPermission]) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard/geen-toegang', request.url));
  }
}
6. Location Map (Fuzzed Privacy Model)
The location screen shows:

Elder's safe zone as a circle on a Dutch map (Mapbox/OpenStreetMap, OSM preferred for EU data residency)
Last known neighbourhood-level fuzzed position (100m+ noise applied before storage)
Safe zone exit events (time of exit, time of return — no route shown)
The map never shows:

Precise GPS coordinates
Route history
Real-time tracking
This is enforced at:

Database level (fuzzed geometry stored; precise auto-deleted after 24h)
API level (PostgREST view masks location_precise column for family role)
UI level (map component only accepts fuzzed coordinates)
7. Family Message Composer
Supported message types (matching family_messages schema):

Type	UI	Elder App Display
Tekst	Text input (max 280 chars, large font preview)	Voice-read aloud by HAVEN
Voice note	Browser mic recording (max 60s)	Playable audio card
Foto	Image upload (max 10MB, HEIC supported)	Full-screen photo
Video hallo	Browser camera recording (max 60s)	Auto-plays once on open
Tekening	Simple canvas (finger/mouse drawing)	Displayed as image
8. Weekly Digest View
The weekly digest (/dashboard/overzicht) renders the safety_digests table record for the current week:

text

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
Family dashboard BUURT visibility rules:
Family members can see the BUURT section ONLY if:
1. Elder has set `neighbourhood_profiles.family_can_see_connections = true` AND
2. `family_relationships.can_view_stories = true` (KRING permission proxy)

What family can see (when permitted):
- Whether elder has a neighbourhood profile (active/inactive)
- Interest tags elder has selected
- Count of connections (accepted only)
- Events elder has marked as interesting

What family can NEVER see (hard rule):
- Identity of any other elder in BUURT (even after connection is accepted)
- Connection request content or anonymous messages
- Whether elder declined any requests (privacy of third parties)

Family dashboard BUURT section UI:
- "Buurt" tab in KRING section
- Shows: "[Voornaam] heeft 2 buurtverbindingen" + interest tags
- Shows: "Komende activiteiten: [event title], [date]"
- Cannot initiate connections on behalf of elder
- Can help set up neighbourhood profile during onboarding

2. OpenAI Whisper
Purpose: Dutch STT for voice interactions Endpoint: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions Model: whisper-1

Request (from fn-voice-pipeline):

text

Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: <audio file, 16kHz mono WAV, max 25MB>
model: whisper-1
language: nl
response_format: json
Response:

JSON

{ "text": "Ik heb mijn pillen al ingenomen." }
Error handling:

429 Rate limit: retry with exponential backoff (3 retries max)
400 Audio too short (< 0.1s): return empty transcript, trigger fallback voice prompt
500: return fallback voice prompt ("Kunt u dat herhalen?")
Data governance:

Audio is sent to OpenAI and not stored after transcription (per OpenAI DPA)
OpenAI DPA signed and on file
Transcript (text only) is stored in voice_interactions
3. OpenAI Embeddings
Purpose: Companion memory similarity, scam event pattern matching, story retrieval Endpoint: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings Model: text-embedding-3-small Dimensions: 1536

Request:

JSON

{
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "input": "Ik houd van mijn kleinkinderen Sofia en Tim.",
  "dimensions": 1536
}
Response:

JSON

{
  "data": [{ "embedding": [...], "index": 0 }],
  "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 14, "total_tokens": 14 }
}
Usage limits:

Called for every voice interaction (companion memory upsert)
Called for every scam event (similarity search)
Called for every life story transcription
Estimated: ~500 tokens/elder/day → ~15k tokens/month/elder
Batched where possible (max 2048 inputs per request)
4. ElevenLabs TTS
Purpose: nl-NL voice output for STEM companion Endpoint: POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream Voice: Custom nl-NL voice "Hanna" (voice_id stored in Supabase Vault)

Request:

JSON

{
  "text": "Goedemorgen! U heeft vandaag twee medicijnen om negen uur.",
  "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.75,
    "similarity_boost": 0.85,
    "style": 0.3,
    "use_speaker_boost": true
  }
}
Response: Audio stream (MP3); streamed to client for low-latency first-byte delivery.

Storage: Audio is NOT stored permanently. The stream is played directly on the device. For offline fallback (Phase 2), a limited set of pre-generated phrases are cached locally.

Failure mode: If ElevenLabs is unavailable, fall back to expo-speech (device TTS) with language: nl-NL. Quality degrades but functionality is maintained.

5. Expo Push Notifications
Purpose: Alert family and elders of medication misses, scam events, family messages Service: Expo Push API → routes to APNs (iOS) or FCM (Android)

Token registration:

TypeScript

// On app launch (after permission granted)
const token = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
  projectId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.eas.projectId
});
await supabase.from('push_tokens').upsert({
  profile_id: session.user.id,
  token: token.data,
  platform: Platform.OS,
  active: true
});
Sending (from fn-notification-dispatch):

TypeScript

await fetch('https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: pushToken,
    title: titleNl,
    body: bodyNl,
    data: extraData,
    priority: priority === 'high' ? 'high' : 'normal',
    sound: priority === 'high' ? 'default' : null,
    badge: 1
  })
});
Consent: Notification permission requested with Dutch explanation. Elder can opt out per notification type in settings.

6. PSD2 / Tink — Banking Integration (Phase 2)
Purpose: Read-only access to Dutch bank accounts for transaction anomaly detection Provider target: Tink (EU-licensed AISP) or Gocardless Banks supported (NL): ING, Rabobank, ABN AMRO, SNS, Triodos

Consent flow:

Elder (or primary family with explicit consent) initiates in-app
HAVEN redirects to Tink OAuth flow
Elder selects their bank and authenticates (strong customer authentication — bank's own)
Tink returns access token → stored encrypted in Supabase Vault (not in DB)
financial_accounts record created (masked account details only)
Data received and stored:

Account identifier: masked (last 4 digits of IBAN only)
Bank name
Transaction date, amount (cents, EUR), counterparty name, description
NO full IBAN, NO full account number, NO authentication credentials
Anomaly scoring:

Large unusual amounts (> 3 standard deviations from 90-day average)
New counterparty + large amount
Multiple small transactions to same new counterparty ("structuring")
Transaction to counterparty flagged in phone_reputation_cache
PSD2 legal basis: AVG Article 6(1)(a) explicit consent + PSD2 Article 67 (AISP access rights)

7. MedMij / PGO — Health Records (Phase 2)
Purpose: Import medication history and GP correspondence from Dutch personal health record Standard: MedMij Afsprakenstelsel v2.x; FHIR R4

Prerequisites:

HAVEN must obtain MedMij toelating (accreditation) — initiate 6 months before Phase 2 launch
Elder must authenticate via a MedMij-approved identity provider (e.g., DigiD — deferred pending Phase 3+ legal/BSN review, see ADR-011)
Elder must have a PGO account (or HAVEN creates one as a PGO participant)
Data imported:

MedicationRequest (FHIR R4): maps to medications table
Appointment (FHIR R4): maps to tasks (huisarts appointments)
AllergyIntolerance (FHIR R4): maps to elder_profiles.allergies
FHIR R4 resource mapping (medications example):

text

MedicationRequest.medicationCodeableConcept.text → medications.name_nl
MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction[0].text → medications.dose_description_nl
MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction[0].timing → medications.frequency + schedule_times
MedicationRequest.medication.code (G-Standaard) → medications.g_standaard_code
8. Call Reputation Service (Phase 2)
Purpose: Look up reputation score for incoming phone numbers in the SCHILD pipeline Target providers (NL-specific):

Fraudehelpdesk API (if public API available) — Dutch fraud reports database
Truecaller API — global call reputation
Marktplaats Veiligheidsteam data sharing (partnership)
Request:

TypeScript

const score = await lookupPhoneReputation(hashedPhone);
// Returns: { score: 0–100, reportCount: number, source: string }
Caching: Results cached in phone_reputation_cache for 7 days. Cache-first always — no live lookup during an active call (latency constraints).

Document 10 — Testing & Observability
1. Testing Strategy
1.1 Philosophy
Testing in HAVEN must validate not only correctness but tone, cognitive load, and dignity. The UX constitution tests (Document 07) are first-class tests — not lint rules.

1.2 Test Pyramid

1.3 Unit Tests
Framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library Coverage target: 80% line coverage on business logic; 70% on UI components

Key areas:

Intent classifier (Dutch phrase → intent mapping)
Medication escalation state machine logic
Scam composite score calculation
Screen schema type validation
Notification dispatch logic
Date/time utilities (Europe/Amsterdam timezone handling)
Dutch number/currency formatting (€ EUR, commas not dots)
1.4 Integration Tests
Framework: Jest + Supabase local (supabase start) Approach: Each Edge Function has a corresponding integration test that:

Seeds the local Supabase DB with fixture data
Calls the Edge Function with test input
Asserts the expected DB state changes + return values
TypeScript

// __tests__/integration/fn-medication-escalation.test.ts
describe('fn-medication-escalation', () => {
  it('escalates a reminder after 30 minutes with no response', async () => {
    // Seed: create a reminder in 'gesnoozed_2' state, 35 minutes ago
    await seedMedicationReminder({ status: 'gesnoozed_2', scheduledAgo: 35 });

    // Run the function
    await invoke('fn-medication-escalation');

    // Assert: status updated to 'geëscaleerd', family notification created
    const reminder = await getReminder();
    expect(reminder.status).toBe('geëscaleerd');
    const notification = await getLatestNotification();
    expect(notification.notification_type).toBe('medicijn_gemist');
  });
});
RLS integration tests:

TypeScript

describe('RLS: family cannot see companion_memory', () => {
  it('returns empty result for family role', async () => {
    const familyClient = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
      global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${familyJwt}` } }
    });
    const { data, error } = await familyClient
      .from('companion_memory')
      .select('*');
    expect(data).toHaveLength(0); // RLS blocks all rows
  });
});
1.5 E2E Tests
Framework:

Elder app (iOS): Maestro
Family dashboard (web): Playwright
Critical flows tested (E2E):

Flow	Tool	Priority
Elder onboarding (family sets up → elder activates)	Maestro	P0
Medication reminder → confirmation	Maestro	P0
Medication reminder → escalation to family	Maestro + Playwright	P0
Scam amber alert → elder dismisses	Maestro	P0
Scam rood alert → family notified	Maestro + Playwright	P0
Voice command: "Ik heb mijn pillen genomen"	Maestro	P0
Crisis phrase: "Ik ben gevallen" → family notified	Maestro + Playwright	P0
Safe zone exit → family dashboard alert	Maestro + Playwright	P1
Family sends voice note → elder receives	Maestro + Playwright	P1
Life story recording → transcript	Maestro	P1
Weekly digest generation → family email	Playwright	P1
Elder consent withdrawal → family loses access	Maestro + Playwright	P0
Maestro example (medication confirmation):

- tapOn: "Ingenomen"
- assertVisible: "Goed gedaan"
- assertNotVisible: "Ingenomen" # button should be gone post-confirmation
1.6 Accessibility Testing
Test	Tool	Standard
Colour contrast	Automated: axe-core (web), Accessibility Scanner (Android)	WCAG 2.1 AA
Touch target sizes	Manual + automated UI test assertions	WCAG 2.5.5 (56×56dp)
Screen reader flow (VoiceOver)	Manual testing protocol — every screen	WCAG 4.1.2
Screen reader flow (TalkBack)	Manual testing protocol — every screen	WCAG 4.1.2
Font scaling (200%)	Automated snapshot tests	WCAG 1.4.4
Keyboard navigation (web dashboard)	Playwright keyboard navigation tests	WCAG 2.1.1
1.7 Test Data & Fixtures
No real elder personal data is ever used in tests
Fixture data is entirely synthetic: generated Dutch names (Jan de Vries, Maria Bakker). No BSN numbers in test data — HAVEN does not store or process BSN
Synthetic voice audio for Whisper testing: recorded by team members reading Dutch test phrases
Test Supabase project (separate from production): haven-test.supabase.co
2. Observability
2.1 Structured Logging
All Edge Functions emit structured JSON logs:

JSON

{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-10T08:32:11.234Z",
  "level": "info",
  "function": "fn-voice-pipeline",
  "elder_id_hash": "sha256:abc123...",  // hashed — never raw UUID in logs
  "intent": "bevestig_ingenomen",
  "duration_ms": 847,
  "whisper_tokens": 12,
  "elevenlabs_chars": 48,
  "action_taken": "CONFIRM_MEDICATION_TAKEN",
  "distress_detected": false
}
Note: elder_id is always SHA-256 hashed in logs. Never log raw personal data.

## Observability stack (v1.2.1 — Supabase-native + standard OSS)

> ⚠️ **CloudWatch references removed in v1.2.1.**
> Supabase Edge Functions do not natively emit to CloudWatch.
> The following stack is the canonical HAVEN observability approach.

### Layer 1 — Error tracking (client + server)
**Tool:** Sentry (EU endpoint — `https://sentry.io`, hosted in EU region)
**What it captures:**
- Elder app crashes + unhandled exceptions (React Native Sentry SDK)
- Family dashboard errors (Next.js Sentry SDK)
- Edge Function exceptions (Deno Sentry SDK)

**PII scrubbing rules (mandatory):**
```typescript
// sentry.config.ts — applies to all surfaces
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.HAVEN_ENV,
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Strip all personal data before sending to Sentry
    if (event.user) {
      delete event.user.email;
      delete event.user.username;
      event.user = { id: event.user.id }; // keep only opaque ID
    }
    // Strip request bodies (may contain voice transcripts)
    if (event.request?.data) {
      delete event.request.data;
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```

### Layer 2 — Edge Function logs + metrics
**Tool:** Supabase built-in Edge Function logs → **log drain to Logflare** (EU region)
or alternatively **Axiom** (EU region, Supabase native integration)

**Structured log format (emit from every Edge Function):**
```typescript
// packages/utils/logger.ts
export function logEvent(params: {
  fn: string;
  elder_id_hash: string;   // SHA-256 of elder_id — never raw ID in logs
  duration_ms: number;
  status: 'success' | 'error' | 'fallback';
  intent?: string;
  error_code?: string;
}) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    ...params,
    ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    env: Deno.env.get('HAVEN_ENV'),
  }));
}
```

**What every Edge Function must log (at minimum):**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fn` | string | Function name |
| `elder_id_hash` | string | SHA-256(elder_id) — never raw |
| `duration_ms` | number | Wall clock time |
| `status` | enum | success / error / fallback |
| `intent` | string | (voice pipeline only) detected intent |
| `error_code` | string | (errors only) |

### Layer 3 — Custom metrics table (p50/p95 dashboarding)
```sql
-- Performance metrics table (service role inserts; no client access)
CREATE TABLE perf_metrics (
  id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  fn_name      text NOT NULL,
  duration_ms  integer NOT NULL,
  status       text NOT NULL,
  env          text DEFAULT 'production',
  recorded_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- No RLS client access; service role only
ALTER TABLE perf_metrics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE perf_metrics FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Retention: 90 days of raw metrics (then aggregate + purge)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'purge-perf-metrics',
  '0 5 * * 0',   -- weekly, Sunday 05:00
  $$
    DELETE FROM perf_metrics
    WHERE recorded_at < now() - interval '90 days';
  $$
);

-- p95 query (use in Supabase Studio dashboard or Metabase):
SELECT
  fn_name,
  percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) AS p50_ms,
  percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) AS p95_ms,
  count(*) AS sample_count,
  date_trunc('hour', recorded_at) AS hour
FROM perf_metrics
WHERE recorded_at > now() - interval '24 hours'
  AND env = 'production'
GROUP BY fn_name, hour
ORDER BY hour DESC, fn_name;
```

### Layer 4 — SLO measurement (canonical, replaces all CloudWatch references)

| SLO | Metric source | Measurement query |
|---|---|---|
| Voice pipeline p95 ≤ 3s | `perf_metrics` WHERE fn_name = 'fn-voice-pipeline' | `percentile_cont(0.95)` over rolling 1h window |
| Push delivery p95 ≤ 5s | `notifications.created_at` vs `notifications.sent_at` | `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (sent_at - created_at)) * 1000` |
| Safe-zone notification p95 ≤ 15s | `location_events.created_at` vs `notifications.created_at` | JOIN on metadata->>'source_event_id' |
| Medication escalation p95 ≤ 10min | `medication_reminders.scheduled_time` vs `medication_reminders.first_reminded_at` | EXTRACT EPOCH |
| Elder app cold start p95 ≤ 4s | Sentry performance transactions | Filter: op='app.start' |
| Family dashboard TTFB p95 ≤ 800ms | Vercel Analytics (built-in) | No additional setup |

### Layer 5 — Alerting (PagerDuty / Slack integration)
**Tool:** Supabase Database Webhooks → Slack webhook (staging/production alerts channel)

```sql
-- Alert on P0 error spike (>5 errors in 5 minutes from any Edge Function)
-- Implement as a Supabase Database Webhook on perf_metrics INSERT
-- with a pg_notify trigger:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_error_spike()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  error_count integer;
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'error' THEN
    SELECT count(*) INTO error_count
    FROM perf_metrics
    WHERE status = 'error'
      AND fn_name = NEW.fn_name
      AND recorded_at > now() - interval '5 minutes'
      AND env = 'production';

    IF error_count >= 5 THEN
      PERFORM pg_notify(
        'haven_alert',
        json_build_object(
          'type',     'error_spike',
          'fn',       NEW.fn_name,
          'count',    error_count,
          'ts',       now()
        )::text
      );
    END IF;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_error_spike_alert
  AFTER INSERT ON perf_metrics
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_error_spike();
```

**Slack message format** (sent by a Supabase Edge Function subscribed to `haven_alert`):
```
🚨 HAVEN ALERT — Production

Error count: 6 in last 5 minutes
Time: 2026-06-10T14:32:00Z

# HAVEN — Addendum Document Suite (v1.0.0)

**Status:** Approved — SSOT addendums to `Havenbuildcompletedesigndoc.md`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last updated:** 2026-06-10
**Locale:** Netherlands (nl-NL) / EU
**These documents patch the gaps identified in the gap audit and together with `Havenbuildcompletedesigndoc.md` constitute the complete engineer reference.**

# Addendum A — RLS Policies (Complete SQL)

**File:** `docs/addenda/A-rls-policies.md`

## 🟢 THIS IS THE CANONICAL RLS SOURCE

This file contains the complete, production-ready `CREATE POLICY` SQL for
every table in HAVEN. It is the single RLS source of truth.

Doc 05 contains illustrative summaries only — do not implement from Doc 05.

Precedence: **Addendum A > Doc 05** for all RLS definitions.

---

## A.1 Principles
- Every user-data table has RLS **enabled + forced**
- Service role (Edge Functions) bypasses RLS via `service_role` key — **never expose this to clients**
- Policies follow the pattern: `elder owns their rows`, `family reads with consent + permission flag`, `carers read with active relationship`
- `deleted_at IS NULL` is included in all `SELECT` policies (soft-delete enforcement)

## A.2 Helper functions (create first)

```sql
-- Returns the role claim from the JWT
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.user_role()
RETURNS text
LANGUAGE sql STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(
    current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'role',
    'anonymous'
  )
$$;

-- Returns the elder_id the current user IS (if role = elder)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.elder_id()
RETURNS uuid
LANGUAGE sql STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT CASE
    WHEN auth.user_role() = 'elder' THEN auth.uid()
    ELSE NULL
  END
$$;

-- Returns true if current user is a consented family member
-- for the given elder_id with a specific permission flag
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.family_can(
  p_elder_id uuid,
  p_permission text
)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM family_relationships fr
    WHERE fr.family_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND fr.elder_id = p_elder_id
      AND fr.elder_consented = true
      AND fr.is_active = true
      AND CASE p_permission
            WHEN 'meds'      THEN fr.can_view_meds
            WHEN 'messages'  THEN fr.can_view_messages
            WHEN 'location'  THEN fr.can_view_location
            WHEN 'alerts'    THEN fr.can_view_alerts
            WHEN 'stories'   THEN fr.can_view_stories
            WHEN 'financials' THEN fr.can_view_financials
            ELSE false
          END = true
  )
$$;

-- Returns true if current user is an active carer for elder_id
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.carer_can(
  p_elder_id uuid
)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM carer_relationships cr
    WHERE cr.carer_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND cr.elder_id = p_elder_id

# Addendum B — Database Indexes & Migration Strategy

**File:** `docs/addenda/B-db-indexes-migrations.md`

## B.1 Index strategy

### B.1.1 Standard FK + query indexes

```sql
-- profiles
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_role ON profiles(role);

-- elder_profiles
CREATE INDEX idx_elder_profiles_elder_id ON elder_profiles(elder_id);

-- family_relationships
CREATE INDEX idx_fam_rel_elder_id ON family_relationships(elder_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_fam_rel_family_user_id ON family_relationships(family_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_fam_rel_active ON family_relationships(elder_id, is_active)
  WHERE is_active = true AND elder_consented = true;

-- medications (active only — most common query)
CREATE INDEX idx_medications_elder_active ON medications(elder_id)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- medication_reminders (cron query: upcoming + overdue)
CREATE INDEX idx_reminders_scheduled ON medication_reminders(scheduled_for)
  WHERE status IN ('pending', 'overdue');
CREATE INDEX idx_reminders_medication_id ON medication_reminders(medication_id);

-- family_messages
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_elder_id ON family_messages(elder_id)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_created ON family_messages(elder_id, created_at DESC)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- scam_events
CREATE INDEX idx_scam_elder_id ON scam_events(elder_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_scam_created ON scam_events(elder_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_scam_alert_level ON scam_events(alert_level)
  WHERE family_notified = false;

-- location_events
CREATE INDEX idx_location_elder_time ON location_events(elder_id, created_at DESC);

-- notifications
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_recipient ON notifications(recipient_id)
  WHERE read_at IS NULL;

-- voice_interactions
CREATE INDEX idx_voice_elder_time ON voice_interactions(elder_id, created_at DESC);

-- cognitive_checkins
CREATE INDEX idx_cognitive_elder_time ON cognitive_checkins(elder_id, created_at DESC);

-- life_stories
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_elder ON life_stories(elder_id)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- companion_memory
CREATE INDEX idx_memory_elder ON companion_memory(elder_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_memory_type ON companion_memory(elder_id, memory_type);
```

---

### B.1.2 PostGIS indexes (safe-zone + location)

```sql
-- Safe-zone centre on elder_profiles
CREATE INDEX idx_elder_safe_zone_centre
  ON elder_profiles USING GIST (safe_zone_centre);

-- Fuzzed geometry on location_events
CREATE INDEX idx_location_events_geom
  ON location_events USING GIST (location_fuzzed);
```

---

### B.1.3 pgvector indexes (HNSW — recommended over IVFFlat for HAVEN's workload)

```sql
-- voice_interactions embeddings
CREATE INDEX idx_voice_embedding
  ON voice_interactions USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- companion_memory embeddings
CREATE INDEX idx_companion_memory_embedding
  ON companion_memory USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- life_stories embeddings
CREATE INDEX idx_life_stories_embedding
  ON life_stories USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- scam_events embeddings (for similarity matching across events)
CREATE INDEX idx_scam_events_embedding
  ON scam_events USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

**HNSW parameter guidance:**
- `m = 16` is the default and appropriate for HAVEN's data volumes at launch
- `ef_construction = 64` balances build time vs. recall quality
- Re-evaluate at 100k+ rows per table with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

---

## B.2 Migration strategy

### B.2.1 Tooling
Use **Supabase CLI** (`supabase migrate`) as the single migration tool.

```bash
# Init (once, in monorepo root)
supabase init

# Create a new migration
supabase migration new <descriptive_name>
# e.g.: supabase migration new add_medications_table

# Apply locally
supabase db reset   # full reset + all migrations
supabase db push    # apply pending migrations to linked project

# List migrations
supabase migration list
```

---

### B.2.2 File naming convention

### B.2.3 Migration rules (non-negotiable)
1. **Never edit an applied migration** — create a new one
2. **No destructive changes in a single migration** — always: add column nullable → backfill → add constraint → drop old column (separate migrations)
3. **Every migration is idempotent** where possible (use `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`)
4. **Migrations must pass locally before PR merge** (enforced in CI — see Addendum I)
5. **Production migrations are applied manually by a named engineer** with a signed-off checklist (not auto-deployed)

### B.2.5 Breaking change protocol
Before any breaking DB change in production:
1. Deploy backwards-compatible version (new column nullable, old + new code paths live)
2. Verify both paths work in production
3. Migrate data (Edge Function or SQL job)
4. Remove old column/code path in a follow-up deploy
5. Document in ADRs if the change affects the data model significantly

# Addendum C — Authentication & Onboarding Flows

**File:** `docs/addenda/C-auth-flows.md`

## C.1 Auth method decisions

| Actor | Auth method | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Elder | **OTP (SMS or email)** — no password | Passwords are a cognitive barrier; OTP via SMS is familiar to Dutch older adults via iDEAL/DigiD patterns |
| Family | **Magic link email** or **OTP** | Low friction for initial setup |
| Carer (Phase 2) | **Email + password + MFA** | Professional context; higher security requirement |
| Edge Functions | Supabase service role key | Never client-facing |

**Implementation:** Supabase Auth (built-in OTP + magic link support).

---

## C.2 JWT custom claims

Custom claims are injected via a Supabase Auth hook (PostgreSQL function):

```sql
-- Auth hook: inject role + elder_context into JWT
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.custom_claims(event jsonb)
RETURNS jsonb
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role text;
  claims jsonb;
BEGIN
  SELECT role INTO user_role
  FROM profiles
  WHERE id = (event->>'user_id')::uuid;

  claims := event->'claims';
  claims := jsonb_set(claims, '{role}', to_jsonb(user_role));

  RETURN jsonb_set(event, '{claims}', claims);
END;
$$;
```

---

## C.3 Onboarding flow (family-initiated, elder-activates)

This is the single most critical UX + auth flow in the product.

```
STEP 1 — Family registers
  Family member opens Family Dashboard
  Enters email → receives magic link
  Completes profile (name, relation to elder)
  ↓
STEP 2 — Family creates elder profile
  Family enters elder's:
    - First name (no BSN — see ADR-008)
    - Date of birth (optional)
    - Language preference (nl-NL default)
    - Phone number (for OTP delivery to elder)
  System creates:
    - auth.users row for elder (unconfirmed)
    - profiles row (role = elder)
    - elder_profiles row
    - family_relationships row
      (elder_consented = false, is_active = false)
  ↓
STEP 3 — Elder receives activation
  System sends elder an SMS:
    "Welkom bij HAVEN. Uw familie heeft een account
     voor u aangemaakt. Druk op [link] of bel [nummer]
     om te starten."
  ↓
STEP 4 — Elder activates (voice-guided)
  Elder opens app (deep link from SMS)
  App presents: "Bent u [Voornaam]?"
  Elder confirms by tapping large YES button or saying "Ja"
  Elder receives OTP SMS
  Elder enters OTP (large keypad, auto-submit on 6 digits)
  ↓
STEP 5 — Consent screen (elder grants family permissions)
  App reads aloud (Dutch, TTS):
    "[Familienaam] wil uw herinneringsberichten,
     medicijnen en veiligheidsberichten kunnen zien.
     Gaat u daarmee akkoord?"
  Elder taps "Ja, dat is goed" or "Nee"
  System sets elder_consented = true per permission flag
  family_relationships.is_active = true
  ↓
STEP 6 — Elder onboarding complete
  App: "Welkom bij HAVEN, [Voornaam]. Ik ben uw
        digitale hulp. Wat wilt u doen?"
  Home screen renders
```

---

## C.4 Session management

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Token expiry (elder app, foreground) | Silent refresh via Supabase SDK |
| Token expiry (elder app, background/offline) | Show friendly re-auth screen on next open: "Welkom terug! Voer uw code in." |
| Token expiry (family dashboard) | Redirect to login; preserve intended route |
| Invalid session | Clear local storage; restart auth flow |
| Elder device lost/stolen | Family can trigger session revocation from dashboard (service function) |

---

## C.5 Family invite link flow

```
Family dashboard → "Voeg familielid toe"
  → System generates signed invite token (expiry: 72h)
  → Family shares link via WhatsApp/email (standard NL pattern)
  → New family member clicks link
  → Registers with email OTP
  → Relationship row created (elder_consented = false)
  → Elder receives in-app notification:
    "[Naam] wil uw HAVEN-hulp kunnen zien. Akkoord?"
  → Elder approves → elder_consented = true
```

---

## C.6 Permission revocation (elder withdraws consent)

```
Elder: Settings → "Mijn Familie" → [Familienaam] → "Toegang intrekken"
  → Confirm screen (TTS reads aloud)
  → family_relationships.elder_consented = false
  → family_relationships.is_active = false
  → All active sessions for that family member lose access immediately
  → Family member receives email: "Toegang ingetrokken"
```

---

# Addendum D — Offline & Sync Strategy

**File:** `docs/addenda/D-offline-sync.md`

## D.1 Offline philosophy
> **The elder app must never show a dead or broken state.** The family dashboard can tolerate a loading/stale indicator.

---

## D.2 What is cached locally (elder app)

| Data | Cache duration | Storage method |
|---|---|---|
| Today's medication reminders | 24 hours | SQLite via Expo SQLite |
| Today's tasks | 24 hours | SQLite |
| Last 10 family messages | 7 days | SQLite |
| Current elder profile | 24 hours | SQLite |
| Recent life story prompts | 7 days | SQLite |
| Voice responses (last 5) | Session only | In-memory |
| Home screen badge counts | 1 hour | SQLite |
| Safe-zone config | 24 hours | SQLite |

**NOT cached locally:**
- Scam event full details (privacy + freshness required)
- Location events (server only)
- Companion memory (server only)

---

## D.3 Offline-first reminder firing

```
Scheduled reminder fires (local notification — device-native, not push)
  ↓
Elder responds (taken / snooze)
  ↓
Action queued in local action queue (SQLite)
  ↓
App checks connectivity
  ├── Online → flush queue immediately
  └── Offline → retry every 60s with exponential backoff
              → max 5 retries
              → if still offline after 5 retries:
                   mark as "pending_sync"
                   continue functioning locally
  ↓
On next foreground + online:
  flush all pending_sync actions
  reconcile with server state
```

---

## D.4 Conflict resolution rules

| Scenario | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Elder marks med taken offline; server already shows escalated | Accept elder's action; clear escalation; log reconciliation |
| Elder creates task offline; duplicate detected on sync | Keep elder's version; deduplicate by idempotency key |
| Family message sent while elder offline | Message sits in queue; delivered on reconnect; no duplicate |
| Companion memory update conflicts | Server wins; local cache refreshed |

**Idempotency key pattern:**
Every offline action has an `idempotency_key = uuid()` generated at creation time. Edge Functions check for duplicate keys and return the existing result if already processed.

---

## D.5 Family dashboard offline behaviour

The family dashboard is a **web app** — full offline is not a goal. Behaviour:

- **Offline detected:** Show banner "Geen verbinding — gegevens kunnen verouderd zijn"
- Supabase Realtime subscription pauses; reconnects automatically
- No queuing of family actions (messages, permission changes) while offline — user must retry manually

---

## D.6 Local notification strategy (elder app)

Medication reminders and daily rhythm events are **local notifications** first (not push-only), so they fire even if push is unavailable:

```typescript
// Scheduled at onboarding + updated when reminder schedule changes
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

async function scheduleLocalReminder(reminder: MedicationReminder) {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: 'Medicijntijd 💊',
      body: `Vergeet uw ${reminder.medication_name_nl} niet.`,
      data: { reminder_id: reminder.id, screen: 'PILLS' },
    },
    trigger: {
      date: new Date(reminder.scheduled_for),
    },
    identifier: reminder.id, // idempotent
  });
}
```

Push notifications are used for **family-initiated events** (messages, check-ins) and **escalation events** only.

---

# Addendum E — Supabase Storage Specification

**File:** `docs/addenda/E-storage-spec.md`

## E.1 Bucket definitions

| Bucket name | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `voice-notes` | Private | Family ↔ Elder audio messages |
| `life-story-audio` | Private | Elder story recordings |
| `life-story-photos` | Private | Photos attached to life stories |
| `profile-photos` | Private | Elder + family profile photos |
| `document-vault` | Private | Scanned documents (no BSN per ADR-008) |
| `ocr-inbox` | Private (transient) | Medication photo OCR input; auto-deleted after processing |
| `tts-cache` | Private (transient) | Pre-generated TTS audio; short TTL |

**No public buckets** — all content served via signed URLs only.

---

## E.2 File path conventions

```
voice-notes/
  {elder_id}/{message_id}.m4a

life-story-audio/
  {elder_id}/{story_id}.m4a

life-story-photos/
  {elder_id}/{story_id}/{photo_id}.jpg

profile-photos/
  {user_id}/avatar.jpg

document-vault/
  {elder_id}/{document_id}/{filename}

ocr-inbox/
  {elder_id}/pending/{upload_id}.jpg

tts-cache/
  {elder_id}/{interaction_id}.mp3
```

---

## E.3 Storage RLS policies

```sql
-- voice-notes: elder reads/writes own; family reads with permission
CREATE POLICY "voice_notes_elder_all"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
USING (
  bucket_id = 'voice-notes'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

CREATE POLICY "voice_notes_family_read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'voice-notes'
  AND auth.family_can(
    (storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid,
    'messages'
  )
);

-- life-story-audio: elder all; family reads with stories permission
CREATE POLICY "story_audio_elder_all"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
USING (
  bucket_id = 'life-story-audio'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

CREATE POLICY "story_audio_family_read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'life-story-audio'
  AND auth.family_can(
    (storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid,
    'stories'
  )
);

-- document-vault: elder only (no family access to documents)
CREATE POLICY "document_vault_elder_only"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
USING (
  bucket_id = 'document-vault'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- ocr-inbox: elder write; service-role read for processing
CREATE POLICY "ocr_inbox_elder_write"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'ocr-inbox'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

---

## E.4 File size limits

| Bucket | Max file size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `voice-notes` | 15 MB | ~10 min audio at low bitrate |
| `life-story-audio` | 50 MB | ~30 min |
| `life-story-photos` | 8 MB | Compressed on client before upload |
| `profile-photos` | 2 MB | Compressed to 512×512 max |
| `document-vault` | 10 MB | PDF or image |
| `ocr-inbox` | 5 MB | Transient; auto-deleted after OCR |
| `tts-cache` | 2 MB | Short clips only |

---

## E.5 Retention & deletion

```sql
-- pg_cron: delete processed OCR inbox files after 24h
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'clean-ocr-inbox',
  '0 * * * *',  -- hourly
  $$
    DELETE FROM storage.objects
    WHERE bucket_id = 'ocr-inbox'
      AND created_at < now() - interval '24 hours';
  $$
);

-- pg_cron: delete TTS cache after 48h
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'clean-tts-cache',
  '30 * * * *',
  $$
    DELETE FROM storage.objects
    WHERE bucket_id = 'tts-cache'
      AND created_at < now() - interval '48 hours';
  $$
);
```

**GDPR right-to-erasure:** When an elder account is deleted, a service function cascades deletion across all buckets for that `elder_id`. This is a hard requirement.

---

## E.6 Signed URL generation (client pattern)

```typescript
// Never expose raw storage paths to clients
// Always generate short-lived signed URLs server-side or via Edge Function

const { data } = await supabase.storage
  .from('voice-notes')
  .createSignedUrl(`${elderId}/${messageId}.m4a`, 300); // 5 min TTL

// Family dashboard: signed URL requested per message render
// Elder app: signed URL cached for session duration of playback
```

---

# Addendum F — Error States, Empty States & Dutch UI Copy

**File:** `docs/addenda/F-copy-and-states.md`

## F.1 Dutch copy style guide

### F.1.1 Pronoun register (critical for NL elder UX)
**Use formal "u" / "uw" throughout the elder app.**

This is non-negotiable for a 68–90 year old Dutch audience. Using "jij/je" with older Dutch adults is widely perceived as disrespectful or overly casual.

| ❌ Do not use | ✅ Use instead |
|---|---|
| "Je hebt je medicijn genomen" | "U heeft uw medicijn genomen" |
| "Jij kunt dit later doen" | "U kunt dit later doen" |
| "Wat wil jij vandaag doen?" | "Wat wilt u vandaag doen?" |
| "Je bent buiten je veilige zone" | "U bent buiten uw veilige zone" |

**Family dashboard:** informal "je/jij" is acceptable (younger audience).

---

### F.1.2 Sentence length rules (voice + screen)

| Context | Max sentence length | Rationale |

### F.1.3 Banned words (enforced in CI)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT EU AI ACT COMPLIANCE RULE:
// EU AI Act Art. 50 requires disclosure that the user is interacting with
// an AI system (unless context makes it obvious). Therefore:

// BANNED — because they are evasive/misleading (not because they mention AI):
const BANNED_AI_COPY = [
  'Ik ben een echte medewerker',        // false claim of human identity
  'Ik ben geen computer',               // deceptive denial
  'U spreekt met een persoon',          // impersonation
];

// REQUIRED — first interaction per day must include a disclosure variant:
const REQUIRED_AI_DISCLOSURE_NL = [
  // Option A (warm, brief):
  'Hallo, ik ben HAVEN — uw digitale hulp.',
  // Option B (slightly more explicit, for first-ever use):
  'Hallo, ik ben HAVEN. Ik ben een digitale hulp, geen echte persoon.',
  // Option C (if elder directly asks "ben jij een mens?"):
  'Nee, ik ben een digitale hulp. Maar ik ben er wel voor u.',
];

// RULE: If a user directly asks "ben jij een mens?" or "ben jij echt?",
// HAVEN MUST answer honestly. This is a hard product rule, not just a
// compliance rule — it is also the right thing to do for elder dignity.

// STILL BANNED (tone/anxiety reasons, unchanged):
const BANNED_WORDS_NL = [
  'fout', 'foutmelding', 'error', 'mislukt',
  'gevaar', 'gevaarlijk', 'waarschuwing', 'kritiek',
  'illegaal',
  'nooit', 'altijd', 'onmogelijk',
];

// Allowed exceptions for SCHILD screens only
const SCHILD_EXCEPTIONS = ['verdacht', 'voorzichtig'];
```

### F.1.4 Number & date formatting (NL)

| Format | Correct NL | Incorrect |
|---|---|---|
| Date (long) | `maandag 10 juni 2026` | `Monday, June 10, 2026` |
| Date (short) | `10-06-2026` | `06/10/2026` |

## F.3 Error states (Dutch copy)

### Network error (elder app)
**Title:** "Geen verbinding"
**Body:** "HAVEN werkt nu zonder internet. Uw herinneringen werken gewoon."
**Voice:** "Even geen internet. Uw medicijnherinneringen werken gewoon door."
**Action:** No retry button — app continues in offline mode silently.

---

### Voice not understood
**Title:** *(no title — voice-only response)*
**Voice:** "Ik heb u niet goed verstaan. Kunt u het nog eens zeggen?"
*(after 2 failures):* "Wilt u de knop gebruiken?"
*(after 3 failures):* *(show button alternatives silently)*

---

### SCHILD — suspicious call (amber)
**Title:** "Dit nummer is mogelijk verdacht"
**Body:** "Geef nooit uw pincode of wachtwoord door. U hoeft nu nergens op te klikken."
**Voice:** "Wees voorzichtig. Dit nummer is mogelijk verdacht. U hoeft niets te doen."
**CTA:** "Ik begrijp het" / "Terugbellen"

---

### SCHILD — high-risk alert (red)
**Title:** "Wees voorzichtig"
**Body:** "Wij hebben uw familie gewaarschuwd. U hoeft niets te doen."
**Voice:** "Uw familie is gewaarschuwd. U hoeft niets te doen. U bent veilig."
**CTA:** "Bel familie" / "Bel 112"

---

### Session expired (elder app)
**Title:** "Welkom terug"
**Body:** "Voer uw code in om verder te gaan."
**Voice:** "Welkom terug. Voer uw code in."

### BUURT copy (nl-NL, formal "u/uw" register)

#### Anonymous proximity display
"Er zijn 3 mensen in uw buurt die ook HAVEN gebruiken."
"Er is 1 persoon in uw buurt die ook HAVEN gebruikt."
"Er zijn nog geen HAVEN-gebruikers in uw directe buurt gevonden."

#### Interest match display
"Iemand vlakbij houdt ook van 🌿 tuinieren."
"2 mensen in uw buurt houden ook van 🎵 muziek."

#### Connection request (incoming — voice + screen)
"Iemand in uw buurt die ook van [tag] houdt wil graag kennismaken. Uw naam wordt pas gedeeld als u allebei ja zegt."

#### Connection accepted
"Goed nieuws! U heeft een nieuwe buurtverbinding. Uw naam is nu gedeeld. Misschien ziet u elkaar binnenkort."

#### Connection declined (to initiator)
"De persoon heeft helaas nee gezegd. Dat is prima."
*(No shame language; normalize declining)*

#### Walk buddy request
"Wilt u dat HAVEN een wandelmaatje zoekt? Iemand in uw buurt gaat ook graag 's ochtends wandelen."

#### Walk buddy match found
"Goed nieuws! Er is een wandelmaatje gevonden in uw buurt. Wilt u kennismaken?"

#### Event suggestion
"[Event title], [distance], [day]. Het is gratis. Twee mensen in uw buurt hebben hier ook interesse in."

#### Privacy reassurance (shown on opt-in screen)
"HAVEN deelt nooit uw adres of foto. Alleen uw voornaam — en alleen als u allebei ja zegt."

#### Opt-out confirmation
"U heeft de Buurtverbinder uitgeschakeld. Uw buurtprofiel is verwijderd."

#### Banned words for BUURT specifically
- "In uw buurt woont..." (implies address knowledge — forbidden)
- "Uw buurman/buurvrouw..." (implies identity before consent)
- "We weten waar u woont..." (alarming — obviously forbidden)

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<from supabase start output>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALE=nl-NL
```

### Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/.env`)

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<from supabase start output>
STT_PROVIDER_API_KEY=<openai or whisper key>
TTS_PROVIDER_API_KEY=<elevenlabs key>
LLM_API_KEY=<openai key>
PHONE_REPUTATION_API_KEY=<vendor key>
PUSH_VAPID_KEY=<expo push token>
```

---

## G.3 First-time setup (run once)

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/knarayanareddy/Haven-build.git
cd Haven-build

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start Supabase locally (requires Docker running)
supabase start
# Note the output: API URL, anon key, service role key
# Copy these into your .env files

# 4. Run all migrations + seed data
supabase db reset
# This applies all migrations in supabase/migrations/
# and runs supabase/seed.sql

# 5. Verify DB state
supabase db diff  # should show no pending changes

# 6. Start Edge Functions locally
supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/functions/.env

# 7. Start elder app
cd apps/elder
cp .env.example .env  # fill in values
pnpm start
# Then press 'i' for iOS simulator or 'a' for Android

# 8. Start family dashboard
cd apps/family
cp .env.example .env.local  # fill in values
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## G.4 Daily dev workflow

```bash
# Start everything (from monorepo root)
pnpm dev

# This runs (via Turborepo):
#   supabase start (if not already running)
#   supabase functions serve
#   apps/elder: expo start
#   apps/family: next dev

# Reset DB to clean state
supabase db reset

# Create a new migration
supabase migration new <name>

# Run tests
pnpm test               # all tests
pnpm test:unit          # unit tests only
pnpm test:integration   # integration (requires local Supabase)
pnpm test:e2e           # E2E (requires simulators)

# Type check everything
pnpm typecheck

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

---

## G.5 Common issues & fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `supabase start` fails — port conflict | `supabase stop --no-backup && supabase start` |
| OTP not received locally | Use Supabase Studio (localhost:54323) → Auth → Users → manually confirm |
| Edge Function not hot-reloading | Kill `supabase functions serve` and restart |
| Expo QR not scanning | Ensure device + Mac on same Wi-Fi; use tunnel mode |
| Migration fails | Check for syntax errors; run `supabase db lint` |
| pgvector extension not found | Ensure Supabase CLI ≥ 1.200 (includes pgvector) |

## H.2 Package naming

All internal packages are scoped: `@haven/<name>`

```
@haven/ui
@haven/schema
@haven/database
@haven/i18n
@haven/hooks
@haven/utils
```

---

## H.3 `@haven/i18n` structure

```
packages/i18n/
  locales/
    nl-NL/
      common.json       # Shared: button labels, status words
      elder-app.json    # Elder app screens
      family-dash.json  # Family dashboard
      errors.json       # Error + empty state copy
      voice.json        # Voice prompt scripts
    en-GB/
      (same structure — secondary locale)
  index.ts             # i18next config + exports
```

**Key rule:** all Dutch copy lives in `nl-NL/*.json` — **no hardcoded Dutch strings in component files.**

---

## H.4 `@haven/schema` structure

```
packages/schema/
  types.ts              # ScreenSchema TypeScript interfaces
  screens/
    home.schema.ts
    pills.schema.ts
    messages.schema.ts
    story.schema.ts
    safe-zone.schema.ts
    schild-alert.schema.ts
    settings.schema.ts
  registry.ts           # SCREEN_REGISTRY map
  validator.ts          # Schema validation (used in CI tests)
  __tests__/
    constitution.test.ts  # UX constitution CI tests
```

---

## H.5 `@haven/database` structure

```
packages/database/
  client.ts             # Supabase client factory (env-aware)
  types.ts              # Generated DB types (supabase gen types typescript)
  queries/
    medications.ts

    scam-events.ts
    location-events.ts
    family-relationships.ts
    companion-memory.ts
  realtime/
    subscriptions.ts    # Typed realtime subscription helpers
```

**Type generation (run after every migration):**

```bash
supabase gen types typescript \
  --local \
  > packages/database/types.ts
```

---

## H.6 Edge Function structure

```
supabase/functions/
  _shared/              # Shared Deno modules
    supabase.ts         # Supabase admin client
    auth.ts             # JWT verification helpers

```

---

## H.7 Git conventions

### Branch strategy

```
main              ← production-ready; protected; requires PR + review
staging           ← staging environment; auto-deployed
develop           ← integration branch
feature/<ticket>  ← feature branches
fix/<ticket>      ← bug fixes
chore/<ticket>    ← infra/tooling/docs
```

### Commit message format (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat | fix | chore | docs | test | refactor | perf | ci
Scope: elder-app | family-dash | db | edge-fn | schema | i18n | ci

Examples:
  feat(elder-app): add offline medication reminder queue
  fix(db): correct RLS policy on life_stories table
  chore(ci): add schema constitution tests to PR pipeline
  docs(addenda): add offline sync strategy
```

### PR requirements
- At least 1 reviewer approval
- All CI checks passing (see Addendum I)
- `pnpm typecheck` passing
- No new banned words in NL copy

# Addendum J — DPIA Template (AVG Article 35)

**File:** `docs/addenda/J-dpia-template.md`

> ⚠️ **This template must be completed by the responsible DPO or privacy officer before HAVEN begins processing personal data in production. Processing before DPIA completion is an AVG/GDPR violation.**

## J.1 Document information

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | HAVEN |
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Date | *(to be completed)* |
| Responsible | *(DPO name)* |
| Status | **DRAFT — must be completed before launch** |
| AP notification required? | *(to be assessed — likely yes for health-adjacent + location + vulnerable persons)* |

---

## J.2 Description of processing

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Voice-first companion for older adults; fraud protection; medication reminders; family connection |
| **Data subjects** | Older adults (68–90); family members/mantelzorgers; professional carers (Phase 2) |
| **Personal data categories** | Name, date of birth, phone number, location (fuzzed), medication names + schedules, voice recordings (transient), conversation transcripts, wellness check-ins, family relationships, life stories |
| **Special category data** | Health-adjacent data (medication, wellness); potentially data about mental health (bereavement state, cognitive check-ins) |
| **Legal basis** | *(to be determined: consent (Art. 6(1)(a)) + explicit consent for special category (Art. 9(2)(a)) — must be reviewed by legal)* |
| **Retention periods** | See Doc 05 + Addendum B (B.2.5) + Storage spec (Addendum E.5) |
| **Processors / sub-processors** | See Addendum K (Vendor Register) |

---

## J.3 Necessity & proportionality assessment
*(To be completed by DPO)*

| Question | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Is the processing necessary for the stated purpose? | |
| Could the purpose be achieved with less data? | |
| Is the retention period proportionate? | |
| Are special category data minimised? | |
| Is location data fuzzed and short-lived? | |
| Are voice recordings deleted promptly? | |

---

## J.4 Risk assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthorised access to health data | Medium | High | RLS + encryption + audit log |
| Elder voice recording breach | Medium | High | Short retention + encrypted storage |
| Location tracking misuse by family | Medium | High | Fuzzy storage + elder-controlled permissions |
| AI companion providing unsafe advice | Medium | Very high | Crisis phrase detection + 112/113 referral |
| BSN inadvertently collected via document vault | Low | High | UI warnings + no BSN fields in schema |
| Scam event data used to profile elder | Low | Medium | No third-party data sharing |
| Breach notification delay (AVG: 72h to AP) | Low | High | Incident response plan (Addendum L) |

---

## J.5 Consultation
*(To be completed)*
- [ ] Data subjects consulted? (elder + family representatives)
- [ ] AP consulted if high residual risk?
- [ ] Legal counsel reviewed?

---

## J.6 Sign-off
*(DPO signature + date required before production launch)*

---

## J.7 DPIA supplementary item: BUURT feature

The BUURT feature introduces additional processing that must be assessed in the DPIA before activation:

| New processing | Risk level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PC4 postcode stored per elder | Medium | Not precise location, but still geographic data |
| Anonymous proximity matching (count display) | Low | No identifiers exchanged; count only |
| Interest tags profile | Low | Non-sensitive; elder-selected from fixed list |
| Double opt-in connection (name reveal post-consent) | Medium | First name + HAVEN status revealed to another elder |
| Family visibility of connections | Medium | Requires explicit elder consent + permission flag |

Additional AVG Article 6 legal basis required for BUURT:
- Processing basis: Art. 6(1)(a) — explicit consent (elder opts in to BUURT)
- Interest tags: Art. 6(1)(a) — consent
- PC4 neighbourhood: Art. 6(1)(a) — consent
- Name reveal to matched elder: Art. 6(1)(a) — consent (double opt-in IS the consent)

DPO must assess whether BUURT triggers a new or expanded DPIA before Phase 2 launch.

# Addendum K — Vendor Register & DPA Tracking

**File:** `docs/addenda/K-vendor-register.md`

## K.1 Vendor register

> **Hard rule: BSN (Burgerservicenummer) is NEVER transmitted to any vendor. This is a non-negotiable product constraint. Any integration partner requesting BSN transmission must be escalated to the DPO immediately and rejected unless a specific statutory basis is confirmed.**

| Vendor | Purpose | Data shared | Storage location | DPA signed? | SCC needed? | BSN transmitted? | Review date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase | Backend + DB + storage | All personal data | EU (to be confirmed: select EU region in Supabase) | ✅ (Supabase DPA available) | No (EU hosted) | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| OpenAI | STT (Whisper) + LLM + embeddings | Voice transcript text (no names if possible); context text | USA | ⚠️ Required | Yes — SCC required | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| ElevenLabs | TTS voice output | Response text (no personal data) | USA | ⚠️ Required | Yes — SCC required | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| Expo (EAS Build) | Mobile build pipeline | App binary (no personal data) | USA | ✅ | Review | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| Vercel | Family dashboard hosting | Request logs (IP, headers) | USA/EU | ⚠️ Review | Review | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| Sentry | Error tracking | Stack traces, device info | EU option available | ✅ | No if EU region | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| APNs (Apple) | iOS push | Push token + notification payload | USA | Review Apple DPA | Review | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |
| FCM (Google) | Android push | Push token + notification payload | USA | Review Google DPA | Review | Never. Hard rule. | Annual |

---

## K.2 Adding a new vendor (process)

1. Open a `chore(vendor): add <vendor-name>` PR
2. Add vendor to this register with all columns filled
3. DPO reviews + signs off
4. DPA signed with vendor before any data flows to them
5. SCC assessment completed if non-EU storage
6. PR merged only after DPO sign-off

---

## K.3 Removing a vendor (process)

1. Confirm data deletion obligations from existing DPA
2. Request data deletion from vendor (in writing)
3. Receive written confirmation of deletion
4. Archive confirmation + mark vendor as removed in this register
5. Update Addendum J (DPIA) to reflect changed processing

---

## K.4 supplementary items: BUURT feature

| Vendor | Purpose | Data shared | BSN? | DPA? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenData/gemeente APIs (Phase 2+) | Neighbourhood event ingestion | No personal data (events only) | Never | Review per municipality |

Note: if HAVEN integrates with gemeente (municipality) open data portals for event feeds (e.g. Amsterdam Open Data, Rotterdam Open Data), each integration should be reviewed by the DPO — though public event data sharing is typically low-risk.

# Addendum L — Incident Response Plan

**File:** `docs/addenda/L-incident-response.md`

## L.1 Scope
This plan covers **data breaches and security incidents** affecting HAVEN personal data, in compliance with AVG Article 33 (AP notification within 72 hours) and Article 34 (user notification where high risk).

---

## L.2 Severity levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| P0 — Critical | Mass data exposure; production DB accessible without auth | Supabase misconfiguration; RLS disabled |
| P1 — High | Individual elder's health or location data exposed | Broken RLS policy; storage bucket made public |
| P2 — Medium | Session token leaked; limited scope breach | App logging JWT claims |
| P3 — Low | Suspected anomaly; no confirmed breach | Unusual query patterns |

---

## L.3 Response timeline (AVG-aligned)

```
T+0h  → Incident detected (automated alert OR manual report)
T+1h  → Incident lead assigned (on-call engineer)
T+2h  → Initial triage: scope, severity level, data categories affected
T+4h  → Containment action (disable affected function / revoke keys / RLS patch)
T+24h → Internal incident report drafted
T+48h → DPO notified; breach assessment: does this require AP notification?
T+72h → AP (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) notified IF required (P0/P1 likely)
T+72h → Affected users notified IF high risk to rights and freedoms (AVG Art. 34)
T+7d  → Full post-mortem completed
T+14d → Corrective actions deployed + verified
```

# Addendum M — Accessibility Testing Plan

**File:** `docs/addenda/M-accessibility.md`

## M.1 Standard & target

| Standard | Target |
|---|---|
| WCAG | 2.2 AA |
| EU standard | EN 301 549 (where applicable) |
| Screen reader (iOS) | VoiceOver — full navigation without visual |
| Screen reader (Android) | TalkBack — full navigation without visual |
| Motor accessibility | Switch access (iOS) + Switch Access (Android) |

---

## M.2 Automated accessibility checks (in CI)

```bash
# React Native / Expo: use jest-native + @testing-library/react-native
# Every component test must include accessibility assertions:

it('has accessible medication card', () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(<MedicationCard medication={mockMed} />);
  expect(getByRole('button', { name: /Metformine ingenomen/i }))
    .toBeVisible();
});

# Family dashboard: axe-core via jest-axe
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

it('alerts page has no axe violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<AlertsPage />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

---

## M.3 Manual testing checklist (per screen, per release)

### Elder app — VoiceOver/TalkBack

```
[ ] Every interactive element has an accessibilityLabel in Dutch
[ ] Reading order is logical (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
[ ] No "unlabelled button" errors
[ ] Swipe navigation reaches all interactive elements
[ ] Double-tap activates the correct action
[ ] All images have accessibilityLabel or are marked decorative
[ ] Error/empty states are announced correctly
[ ] Voice companion TTS integrates correctly with screen reader
    (does not conflict)
```

---

### Elder app — Visual

```
[ ] Minimum touch target: 48×48dp (WCAG 2.5.5)
[ ] Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for normal text (WCAG 1.4.3)
[ ] Minimum contrast ratio: 3:1 for large text + UI components
[ ] High contrast mode tested (iOS + Android system setting)
[ ] Font scaling tested at 200% (iOS) and 2x (Android)
[ ] No information conveyed by colour alone
[ ] Focus indicator visible for keyboard/switch navigation
```

---

## M.4 Real-user accessibility testing (mandatory before launch)

> **You cannot ship a product for 68–90 year old users without testing with actual 68–90 year old users.** Automated tests catch code issues; they do not catch "I don't understand what this does."

Minimum requirement before closed beta:
- **5 usability sessions** with Dutch older adults (aged 68+)
- At least **2 participants with low digital literacy**
- At least **1 participant using a screen reader**
- Sessions recorded (with consent) and findings fed back into copy + UX updates

---

# Addendum N — Feature Flags & Rollout Strategy

**File:** `docs/addenda/N-feature-flags.md`

## N.1 Feature flag implementation

Feature flags are stored in a Supabase config table (no external dependency needed for MVP):

```sql
CREATE TABLE feature_flags (
  id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  flag_key    text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description text,
  enabled     boolean DEFAULT false,
  rollout_pct integer DEFAULT 0
    CHECK (rollout_pct BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
  elder_ids   uuid[],   -- override: enabled for specific elders
  created_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- No RLS for clients; flags fetched via Edge Function with service role
```

---

## N.2 Flag evaluation (Edge Function helper)

```typescript
// packages/utils/flags.ts
export async function isFlagEnabled(
  flagKey: string,
  elderId: string,
  adminClient: SupabaseClient
): Promise<boolean> {
  const { data: flag } = await adminClient
    .from('feature_flags')
    .select('enabled, rollout_pct, elder_ids')
    .eq('flag_key', flagKey)
    .single();

  if (!flag) return false;
  if (!flag.enabled) return false;
  if (flag.elder_ids?.includes(elderId)) return true;
  if (flag.rollout_pct === 100) return true;
  if (flag.rollout_pct === 0) return false;

  // Deterministic rollout by hashing elder_id
  const hash = parseInt(elderId.replace(/-/g, '').slice(0, 8), 16);
  return (hash % 100) < flag.rollout_pct;
}
```

---

## N.3 MVP flag definitions

```sql
INSERT INTO feature_flags (flag_key, description, enabled, rollout_pct)
VALUES
  ('schild_call_reputation',
   'Show caller reputation indicator',
   false, 0),
  ('anker_medication_ocr',
   'OCR-based medication setup from photo',
   false, 0),
  ('kring_life_story_recording',
   'Enable life story audio recording',
   true, 100),
  ('kompas_safe_zone_alerts',
   'Safe zone exit family notifications',
   true, 100),
  ('stem_companion',
   'Dutch voice companion (STEM)',
   true, 100),
  ('companion_memory',
   'Persistent companion memory',
   false, 0),    -- Phase 2
  ('psd2_transaction_intercept',
   'PSD2 transaction anomaly detection',
   false, 0),   -- Phase 2
  ('wacht_professional_portal',
   'Professional carer portal',
   false, 0),   -- Phase 2
  ('buurt_neighbourhood_connector',
   'BUURT: De Buurtverbinder — anonieme buurtprofielen + interesse-matching',
   false, 0),   -- Phase 2; off by default
  ('buurt_walk_buddy',
   'BUURT: Wandelmaatje matching',
   false, 0),   -- Phase 2; only enable after base BUURT is stable
  ('buurt_events',
   'BUURT: Lokale activiteiten suggesties',
   false, 0);   -- Phase 2
```

---

## N.4 Closed beta rollout sequence

```
Week 1-2:  Internal team only (5 households)
  → All flags at rollout_pct = 0 except core flows
  → Focus: auth, medication reminders, family messages

Week 3-4:  Extended pilot (20 households)
  → Enable: safe-zone alerts, life story recording
  → Focus: SCHILD alert flows, STEM companion

Month 2:   Closed beta (50 households)
  → Full MVP feature set
  → rollout_pct increases to 100 for stable features

Month 3+:  Open beta (invite-only, NL only)
  → Phase 2 flags begin internal testing
```

# Addendum O — Companion Memory Sub-Specification

**File:** `docs/addenda/O-companion-memory.md`

## O.1 What companion memory is

The STEM voice companion maintains a **persistent, elder-specific memory** of:
- Personal facts ("mijn kleindochter heet Sofia")
- Preferences ("ik hou van klassieke muziek")
- Recurring events ("elke dinsdag belt mijn dochter")
- Emotional states (grief, celebration)
- Key life narrative facts (from life stories)

This memory is used to make STEM feel like **a companion who remembers**, not a generic assistant.

---

## O.2 Data model

```sql
See Doc 05 (`9.2 companion_memory`) for the canonical companion_memory DDL and memory_type enum.
```

---

## O.3 Embedding model spec

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| Dimensions | 1536 |
| Similarity metric | Cosine |
| pgvector index | HNSW (m=16, ef_construction=64) — see Addendum B |
| Language | Dutch (nl-NL) text stored + embedded |

---

## O.4 Memory creation pipeline

```
Voice interaction completed (fn-voice-pipeline)
  ↓
LLM extracts memory candidates from transcript
  [{"type": "personal_fact", "content": "mijn kleindochter heet Sofia"}]
  ↓
fn-companion-memory-update (Edge Function)
  ↓
For each candidate:
  1. Generate embedding
  2. Search for near-duplicate (cosine similarity > 0.92)
  ├── Near-duplicate found → update existing + refresh last_referenced
  └── No duplicate → insert new memory
  ↓
Memory stored in companion_memory table
```

---

## O.5 Memory retrieval (prompt injection)

```typescript
// At voice pipeline start, retrieve relevant memories for context

async function getRelevantMemories(
  elderId: string,
  queryText: string,
  adminClient: SupabaseClient
): Promise<CompanionMemory[]> {

  const queryEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(queryText);

  const { data } = await adminClient.rpc('match_companion_memory', {
    p_elder_id: elderId,
    p_query_embedding: queryEmbedding,
    p_match_threshold: 0.75,
    p_match_count: 8,
  });

  return data ?? [];
}
```

```sql
-- Supabase RPC function for memory similarity search
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_companion_memory(
  p_elder_id        uuid,
  p_query_embedding vector(1536),
  p_match_threshold float,
  p_match_count     int
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id               uuid,
  memory_type      memory_type,
  content_nl       text,
  importance_score int,                          -- canonical: importance_score
  similarity       float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    cm.id,
    cm.memory_type,
    cm.content_nl,
    cm.importance_score,                         -- canonical: importance_score
    1 - (cm.embedding <=> p_query_embedding) AS similarity
  FROM companion_memory cm
  WHERE cm.elder_id   = p_elder_id
    AND cm.deleted_at IS NULL
    AND (cm.expires_at IS NULL OR cm.expires_at > now())
    AND 1 - (cm.embedding <=> p_query_embedding) > p_match_threshold
  ORDER BY
    similarity       DESC,
    cm.importance_score DESC                     -- canonical: importance_score
  LIMIT p_match_count;
END;
$$;
```

---

## O.6 Context window management (prompt structure)

```typescript
function buildCompanionPrompt(
  memories: CompanionMemoryRow[],
  currentScreen: string,
): string {

  const memoryContext = memories
    .sort((a, b) => b.importance_score - a.importance_score)  // canonical sort
    .slice(0, 6)
    .map(m => `- ${m.content_nl}`)
    .join('\n');

  return `

# Addendum P — BUURT: Neighbourhood Connector (De Buurtverbinder)

**File:** `docs/addenda/P-buurt-neighbourhood-connector.md`

## P.1 — The problem (NL-verified statistics only)

### P.1.1 Living alone in the Netherlands
At the beginning of 2024, 19 percent of the Dutch population — **3.3 million people** — lived alone. The largest group of people living alone are **women aged 70 and older**, often left living alone after the death of a partner.
Among people aged 70 to 80 specifically, **31% are single** (living alone).
The number of households where the reference person is 65 or older is expected to rise significantly — from **2.5 million in 2024 to 3 million by 2035** — with much of this growth coming from individuals living alone, fuelled by increasing life expectancy, widowhood, and higher divorce rates among older adults.

### P.1.2 Loneliness in the Netherlands (older adults specifically)
Of all people aged **75 and over** in the Netherlands, **51% felt lonely in 2024**. Of those aged **85 and over, 60%** felt lonely.
More than half of the Dutch population older than 65 feels lonely sometimes (RIVM 2024). As people are predominantly **ageing in place** instead of in care homes, their everyday experiences become more localised and **neighbourhood spaces gain traction as important spaces of encounter**.
Among people aged 45 to 75, **social loneliness** — missing a wider social network — is most common.
Of people who do not have regular social contact, **over 46% feel strongly socially lonely**, compared to almost 13% of people who do see, speak, or message someone every week.
Modern society has become increasingly individualistic — signified by smaller households and **longer geographical distance between parents and their children**. Loneliness is negatively associated with physical and mental wellbeing: it is a **strong predictor for premature death, depression, dementia and heart failure**.

**The neighbourhood opportunity:**
Spaces of encounter can serve as important spaces for social contact for older people, and even **reduce their loneliness** — but only if their physical mobility and the accessibility and proximity of these spaces allow them to.
BUURT is HAVEN's answer: **bring the neighbourhood to the elder, not the elder to the neighbourhood.**

### P.1.3 What this means for HAVEN's product rationale
The NL-verified figures above represent a compelling rationale for a Netherlands-specific elder-care product and are the authoritative source for KRING loneliness justifications.

---

## P.2 — Feature definition (BUURT — De Buurtverbinder)
**Pillar assignment:** KRING (connection) — sub-feature of Pillar 3
**Core promise:**
> "U bent niet alleen in uw buurt. Er zijn mensen vlakbij die ook van [tuinieren] houden."
> *(You are not alone in your neighbourhood. There are people nearby who also enjoy gardening.)*

**What BUURT does:**
- **Buurtprofiel**: Elder opts in and selects up to 5 interest tags from a fixed Dutch catalogue.
- **Anonieme nabijheid**: Shows a count only: "3 mensen in uw buurt gebruiken ook HAVEN" — no names, no photos.
- **Interesse-match**: Shows shared interest tags anonymously: "Iemand vlakbij houdt ook van 🌿 tuinieren".
- **Activiteiten**: Hyper-local events within configurable radius: "Gratis lezing over vogels, 600m, donderdag".
- **Wandelmaatje**: "Wilt u dat HAVEN een wandelmaatje zoekt in uw buurt?" — mutual opt-in only.
- **Verbindingsverzoek**: Anonymous request → both parties must accept before any contact.
- **Familie-zichtbaarheid**: Family can see who elder has connected with — only after elder shares this.

---

## P.3 — Privacy architecture (non-negotiable)
This is the most privacy-sensitive feature in HAVEN. Every design decision is AVG-first.
- **Fuzzy location only**: Neighbourhood stored at 4-digit postcode area (PC4) level — never address, never GPS point.
- **No reverse lookup**: PC4 is one-way; there is no way to derive address from stored neighbourhood.
- **Anonymous until double opt-in**: Both parties must actively accept before any identity is revealed.
- **No direct messaging**: HAVEN does not provide a chat function; connections lead to family-mediated or activity-level contact only.
- **Elder controls family visibility**: Family can only see connections if elder explicitly shares them.
- **Full opt-out at any time**: No dark patterns; opt-out deletes neighbourhood profile and all derived data immediately.
- **No persistent location tracking**: BUURT uses a **declared neighbourhood** (elder sets it once), not real-time location.
- **Minimum age gap matching**: Interest matching only; no age, gender, or demographic matching.
- **No profiling for advertising**: Neighbourhood data is never used for targeting, profiling, or third-party purposes.

---

## P.4 — What BUURT explicitly is NOT
- A dating app (no romantic matching, no photos until mutual opt-in)
- A real-time location tracker ("where is my neighbour now?")
- A direct messaging platform (no in-app chat)
- A social network with profiles, followers, or public presence
- A tool for family to see who their parent is socialising with (without elder's consent)
