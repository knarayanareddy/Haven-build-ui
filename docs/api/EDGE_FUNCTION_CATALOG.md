## Security rules

- Service-role functions are deployed with JWT verification disabled only where the design requires scheduler/webhook/admin execution.
- Client-facing functions use JWT verification and RLS/relationship consent.
- No function accepts or stores BSN.
- Raw browser pages and raw scam content are not stored; hashes and explanations are stored.
