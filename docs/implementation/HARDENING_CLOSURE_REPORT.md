# HAVEN Hardening Closure Report

Date: 2026-06-11

## What was closed in this hardening pass

### Phase A — Database realness

- Added typed database surface in `packages/database`.
- Added idempotency tables and cleanup.
- Added integration connection tracking.
- Added static RLS audit test.
- Added storage RLS audit test.
- Expanded seed data across elder/family/carer/health/finance/emergency flows.
- Added local Supabase verification script for environments with Supabase CLI and Docker.

Local Supabase execution cannot be performed inside this current sandbox because Supabase CLI and Docker are not installed. The repository now contains the script to run the required reset/lint in a proper dev machine or CI runner.

### Phase B — Real Expo app

- Replaced the simple scaffold with React Navigation structure.
- Added Supabase Auth provider with SecureStore session storage.
- Added schema-driven screen renderer.
- Added SQLite offline queue implementation.
- Added local notification service.
- Added voice recorder service using Expo AV.
- Added document camera capture service using Expo Camera.
- Added push-token registration service.
- Added EAS build config.

Real iPhone/Android hardware testing cannot be executed in this sandbox. Maestro flows and hardware test protocol are present for a device runner.

### Phase C — Edge Function hardening

- Added strict request validation helper.
- Added authorization helper for elder/family/carer consent checks.
- Added idempotency helper.
- Added retry helper.
- Added Sentry error capture helper with PII scrubbing.
- Added HMAC webhook verification helper.
- Hardened scam pipeline and transaction intercept with validation, auth/idempotency/signature handling.
- Added static hardening tests.

### Phase D — External integrations

- Added OpenAI Whisper/embedding adapter.
- Added companion LLM adapter.
- Added ElevenLabs TTS to Storage adapter.
- Added signed Storage URL function.
- Added PSD2 webhook signature handling.
- Added MedMij/FHIR import function.
- Added log-drain and SLO measurement support.
- Added integration status table so staging cannot accidentally pretend a missing vendor is healthy.

Real vendor production credentials and contracts are still external gates.

### Phase E — Compliance and safety

- Added vendor register table and seed records.
- Added DPIA assessment table and seed records.
- Added breach incident log.
- Added release checks.
- Added privacy policies.
- Added accessibility audit protocol.
- Added pentest scope.
- Added older-adult usability protocol.
- Added copy review rules.

DPIA signature, vendor DPAs, pentest and usability sessions remain human gates.

## Current confidence rating

Engineering scaffold rating after hardening: **8.5/10**.

Not rated 9+ because true production confidence requires a real Supabase reset, generated Supabase DB types from a live instance, real device testing, vendor sandbox credentials and human compliance sign-off.

## Expert feedback closure addendum

An external review identified four production-readiness items. The repository now addresses the implementable items:

1. **URL pathname space bug** — fixed in `scripts/validate-suite.mjs` by using `fileURLToPath(new URL(...))` instead of `.pathname`.
2. **AI mock mode** — added `scripts/mock-ai-server.mjs`, `corepack pnpm run mock:ai`, and `HAVEN_AI_MOCK` / `HAVEN_AI_MOCK_URL` support in `_shared/ai.ts`.
3. **Live RLS integration test harness** — added `tests/integration/live-rls.test.mjs` and `corepack pnpm run test:integration:live`. It runs real Supabase assertions when `HAVEN_LIVE_RLS=1` and test JWTs are provided.
4. **Legal sign-offs** — remain human-owned and are tracked in release/compliance docs and DB tables.
